"1";"1";"2";"Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout"
"2";"1";"3";"he said, as if returning to some former remark of his:"
"3";"1";"4";"“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly... but there was something queer... there was something uncanny about him. I’ll tell"
"4";"1";"5";"you my opinion...."""
"5";"1";"6";"He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind. Tiresome old fool! When we knew him first he"
"6";"1";"7";"used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the"
"7";"1";"8";"distillery."
"8";"1";"9";"“I have my own theory about it,"" he said. “I think it was one of those ... peculiar cases .... But it’s hard to"
"9";"1";"10";"say...."""
"10";"1";"11";"He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory. My uncle saw me staring and said to me:"
"11";"1";"12";"“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear."""
"12";"1";"13";"“Who?"" said I."
"13";"1";"14";"“Father Flynn."""
"14";"1";"15";"“Is he dead?"""
"15";"1";"16";"“Mr. Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house."""
"16";"1";"17";"I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old"
"17";"1";"18";"Cotter."
"18";"1";"19";"“The youngster and he were great friends. The old chap taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great"
"19";"1";"20";"wish for him."""
"20";"1";"21";"“God have mercy on his soul,"" said my aunt piously."
"21";"1";"22";"Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy"
"22";"1";"23";"him by looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate."
"23";"1";"24";"“I wouldn’t like children of mine,"" he said, “to have too much to say to a man like that."""
"24";"1";"25";"“How do you mean, Mr. Cotter?"" asked my aunt."
"25";"1";"26";"“What I mean is,"" said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children. My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads"
"26";"1";"27";"of his own age and not be... Am I right, Jack?"""
"27";"1";"28";"“That’s my principle, too,"" said my uncle. “Let him learn to box his corner. That’s what I’m always saying to that"
"28";"1";"29";"Rosicrucian there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer."
"29";"1";"30";"And that’s what stands to me now. Education is all very fine and large.... Mr. Cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton,"""
"30";"1";"31";"he added to my aunt."
"31";"1";"32";"“No, no, not for me,"" said old Cotter."
"32";"1";"33";"My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table."
"33";"1";"34";"“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr. Cotter?"" she asked."
"34";"1";"35";"“It’s bad for children,"" said old Cotter, “because their mind are so impressionable. When children see things like that,"
"35";"1";"36";"you know, it has an effect...."""
"36";"1";"37";"I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger. Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!"
"37";"1";"38";"It was late when I fell asleep. Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to"
"38";"1";"39";"extract meaning from his unfinished sentences. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the"
"39";"1";"40";"paralytic. I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It"
"40";"1";"41";"murmured, and I understood that it desired to confess something. I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious"
"41";"1";"42";"region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it"
"42";"1";"43";"smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I"
"43";"1";"44";"felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin."
"44";"1";"45";"The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street. It was an unassuming"
"45";"1";"46";"shop, registered under the vague name of Drapery . The drapery consisted mainly of children’s bootees and umbrellas; and on"
"46";"1";"47";"ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying: Umbrellas Re-covered . No notice was visible now for the shutters"
"47";"1";"48";"were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card"
"48";"1";"49";"pinned on the crape. I also approached and read:"
"49";"1";"50";"July 1st, 1895"
"50";"1";"51";"The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s Church,"
"51";"1";"52";"Meath Street), aged sixty-five years."
"52";"1";"53";"R. I. P."
"53";"1";"54";"The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check. Had he not been dead I"
"54";"1";"55";"would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered"
"55";"1";"56";"in his great-coat. Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him"
"56";"1";"57";"from his stupefied doze. It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to"
"57";"1";"58";"allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor. Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose"
"58";"1";"59";"little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat. It may have been these constant showers of"
"59";"1";"60";"snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened, as it always was,"
"60";"1";"61";"with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious."
"61";"1";"62";"I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock. I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the"
"62";"1";"63";"street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went. I found it strange that neither I nor the"
"63";"1";"64";"day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed"
"64";"1";"65";"from something by his death. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal."
"65";"1";"66";"He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly. He had told me stories about"
"66";"1";"67";"the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass"
"67";"1";"68";"and of the different vestments worn by the priest. Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me,"
"68";"1";"69";"asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only"
"69";"1";"70";"imperfections. His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always"
"70";"1";"71";"regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional"
"71";"1";"72";"seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them; and I was not"
"72";"1";"73";"surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as"
"73";"1";"74";"closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions. Often when I thought of this"
"74";"1";"75";"I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice."
"75";"1";"76";"Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he"
"76";"1";"77";"used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately. When he"
"77";"1";"78";"smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip - a habit which had made me"
"78";"1";"79";"feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well."
"79";"1";"80";"As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the"
"80";"1";"81";"dream. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been"
"81";"1";"82";"very far away, in some land where the customs were strange - in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember the end of"
"82";"1";"83";"the dream."
"83";"1";"84";"In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning. It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the"
"84";"1";"85";"houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the hall; and, as"
"85";"1";"86";"it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards"
"86";"1";"87";"interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being"
"87";"1";"88";"scarcely above the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly"
"88";"1";"89";"towards the open door of the dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon"
"89";"1";"90";"to me again repeatedly with her hand."
"90";"1";"91";"I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the"
"91";"1";"92";"candles looked like pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the"
"92";"1";"93";"bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings distracted me. I noticed how"
"93";"1";"94";"clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy"
"94";"1";"95";"came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin."
"95";"1";"96";"But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious,"
"96";"1";"97";"vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with"
"97";"1";"98";"black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room - the flowers."
"98";"1";"99";"We crossed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I"
"99";"1";"100";"groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry"
"100";"1";"101";"and some wine-glasses. She set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister’s"
"101";"1";"102";"bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also"
"102";"1";"103";"but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my"
"103";"1";"104";"refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty"
"104";"1";"105";"fireplace."
"105";"1";"106";"My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:"
"106";"1";"107";"“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world."""
"107";"1";"108";"Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little."
"108";"1";"109";"“Did he... peacefully?"" she asked."
"109";"1";"110";"“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,"" said Eliza. “You couldn’t tell when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death,"
"110";"1";"111";"God be praised."""
"111";"1";"112";"“And everything...?"""
"112";"1";"113";"“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all."""
"113";"1";"114";"“He knew then?"""
"114";"1";"115";"“He was quite resigned."""
"115";"1";"116";"“He looks quite resigned,"" said my aunt."
"116";"1";"117";"“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful"
"117";"1";"118";"and resigned. No one would think he’d make such a beautiful corpse."""
"118";"1";"119";"“Yes, indeed,"" said my aunt."
"119";"1";"120";"She sipped a little more from her glass and said:"
"120";"1";"121";"“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him. You were"
"121";"1";"122";"both very kind to him, I must say."""
"122";"1";"123";"Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees."
"123";"1";"124";"“Ah, poor James!"" she said. “God knows we done all we could, as poor as we are - we wouldn’t see him want anything while"
"124";"1";"125";"he was in it."""
"125";"1";"126";"Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to fall asleep."
"126";"1";"127";"“There’s poor Nannie,"" said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman"
"127";"1";"128";"to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in the chapel. Only for Father"
"128";"1";"129";"O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d done at all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the"
"129";"1";"130";"chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman’s General and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor"
"130";"1";"131";"James’s insurance."""
"131";"1";"132";"“Wasn’t that good of him?"" said my aunt"
"132";"1";"133";"Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly."
"133";"1";"134";"“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,"" she said, “when all is said and done, no friends that a body can"
"134";"1";"135";"trust."""
"135";"1";"136";"“Indeed, that’s true,"" said my aunt. “And I’m sure now that he’s gone to his eternal reward he won’t forget you and all"
"136";"1";"137";"your kindness to him."""
"137";"1";"138";"“Ah, poor James!"" said Eliza. “He was no great trouble to us. You wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now."
"138";"1";"139";"Still, I know he’s gone and all to that...."""
"139";"1";"140";"“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,"" said my aunt."
"140";"1";"141";"“I know that,"" said Eliza. “I won’t be bringing him in his cup of beef-tea any me, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff."
"141";"1";"142";"Ah, poor James!"""
"142";"1";"143";"She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly:"
"143";"1";"144";"“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly. Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d"
"144";"1";"145";"find him with his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth open."""
"145";"1";"146";"She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:"
"146";"1";"147";"“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the"
"147";"1";"148";"old house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one of them"
"148";"1";"149";"new-fangled carriages that makes no noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic wheels, for the day"
"149";"1";"150";"cheap - he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening. He had his"
"150";"1";"151";"mind set on that.... Poor James!"""
"151";"1";"152";"“The Lord have mercy on his soul!"" said my aunt."
"152";"1";"153";"Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the"
"153";"1";"154";"empty grate for some time without speaking."
"154";"1";"155";"“He was too scrupulous always,"" she said. “The duties of the priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you"
"155";"1";"156";"might say, crossed."""
"156";"1";"157";"“Yes,"" said my aunt. “He was a disappointed man. You could see that."""
"157";"1";"158";"A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then"
"158";"1";"159";"returned quietly to my chair in the comer. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery. We waited respectfully for her to"
"159";"1";"160";"break the silence: and after a long pause she said slowly:"
"160";"1";"161";"“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of course, they say it was all right, that it contained"
"161";"1";"162";"nothing, I mean. But still.... They say it was the boy’s fault. But poor James was so nervous, God be merciful to him!"""
"162";"1";"163";"“And was that it?"" said my aunt. “I heard something...."""
"163";"1";"164";"Eliza nodded."
"164";"1";"165";"“That affected his mind,"" she said. “After that he began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by"
"165";"1";"166";"himself. So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere. They looked high up and low"
"166";"1";"167";"down; and still they couldn’t see a sight of him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then they got"
"167";"1";"168";"the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to"
"168";"1";"169";"look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake"
"169";"1";"170";"and laughing-like softly to himself?"""
"170";"1";"171";"She stopped suddenly as if to listen. I too listened; but there was no sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest"
"171";"1";"172";"was lying still in his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle chalice on his breast."
"172";"1";"173";"Eliza resumed:"
"173";"1";"174";"“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when they saw that, that made them think that there was"
"174";"1";"175";"something gone wrong with him...."""
"175";"2";"2";"“Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka!"""
"176";"2";"3";"Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true."
"177";"2";"4";"A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its influence, differences of culture and constitution were"
"178";"2";"5";"waived. We banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in fear: and of the number of these latter,"
"179";"2";"6";"the reluctant Indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The adventures related in the"
"180";"2";"7";"literature of the Wild West were remote from my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape. I liked better some"
"181";"2";"8";"American detective stories which were traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls. Though there was"
"182";"2";"9";"nothing wrong in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at school."
"183";"2";"10";"One day when Father Butler was hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered with a copy of The"
"184";"2";"11";"Halfpenny Marvel ."
"185";"2";"12";"“This page or this page? This page Now, Dillon, up! ""˜Hardly had the day’ ... Go on! What day? ""˜Hardly had the day dawned’"
"186";"2";"13";"... Have you studied it? What have you there in your pocket?"""
"187";"2";"14";"Everyone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and everyone assumed an innocent face. Father Butler turned"
"188";"2";"15";"over the pages, frowning."
"189";"2";"16";"“What is this rubbish?"" he said. “The Apache Chief! Is this what you read instead of studying your Roman History? Let me"
"190";"2";"17";"not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I suppose, was some wretched fellow who"
"191";"2";"18";"writes these things for a drink. I’m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could understand it if you"
"192";"2";"19";"were ... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I advise you strongly, get at your work or..."""
"193";"2";"20";"This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face"
"194";"2";"21";"of Leo Dillon awakened one of my consciences. But when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance I began to"
"195";"2";"22";"hunger again for wild sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me. The mimic"
"196";"2";"23";"warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because I wanted real"
"197";"2";"24";"adventures to happen to myself. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be"
"198";"2";"25";"sought abroad."
"199";"2";"26";"The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break out of the weariness of schoollife for one day at"
"200";"2";"27";"least. With Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching. Each of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet at"
"201";"2";"28";"ten in the morning on the Canal Bridge. Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo Dillon was to tell his"
"202";"2";"29";"brother to say he was sick. We arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the"
"203";"2";"30";"ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House. Leo Dillon was afraid we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the"
"204";"2";"31";"college; but Mahony asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the Pigeon House. We were reassured: and"
"205";"2";"32";"I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my"
"206";"2";"33";"own sixpence. When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands, laughing,"
"207";"2";"34";"and Mahony said:"
"208";"2";"35";"“Till tomorrow, mates!"""
"209";"2";"36";"That night I slept badly. In the morning I was firstcomer to the bridge as I lived nearest. I hid my books in the long"
"210";"2";"37";"grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank. It was a mild sunny"
"211";"2";"38";"morning in the first week of June. I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had"
"212";"2";"39";"diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill. All the"
"213";"2";"40";"branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through"
"214";"2";"41";"them on to the water. The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands in time"
"215";"2";"42";"to an air in my head. I was very happy."
"216";"2";"43";"When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony’s grey suit approaching. He came up the hill, smiling,"
"217";"2";"44";"and clambered up beside me on the bridge. While we were waiting he brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner"
"218";"2";"45";"pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it. I asked him why he had brought it and he told me he had"
"219";"2";"46";"brought it to have some gas with the birds. Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We waited on"
"220";"2";"47";"for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:"
"221";"2";"48";"“Come along. I knew Fatty’d funk it."""
"222";"2";"49";"“And his sixpence...?"" I said."
"223";"2";"50";"“That’s forfeit,"" said Mahony. “And so much the better for us - a bob and a tanner instead of a bob."""
"224";"2";"51";"We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works and then turned to the right along the Wharf"
"225";"2";"52";"Road. Mahony began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing"
"226";"2";"53";"his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should"
"227";"2";"54";"charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: “Swaddlers!"
"228";"2";"55";"Swaddlers!"" thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket"
"229";"2";"56";"club in his cap. When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least"
"230";"2";"57";"three. We revenged ourselves on Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at three o’clock"
"231";"2";"58";"from Mr. Ryan."
"232";"2";"59";"We came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching"
"233";"2";"60";"the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts. It was"
"234";"2";"61";"noon when we reached the quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big currant buns"
"235";"2";"62";"and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s commerce"
"236";"2";"63";"- the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white"
"237";"2";"64";"sailingvessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay. Mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one"
"238";"2";"65";"of those big ships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily dosed to"
"239";"2";"66";"me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes. School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us"
"240";"2";"67";"seemed to wane."
"241";"2";"68";"We crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little"
"242";"2";"69";"Jew with a bag. We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short voyage our eyes met and we laughed."
"243";"2";"70";"When we landed we watched the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the other quay. Some"
"244";"2";"71";"bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel. I went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to"
"245";"2";"72";"do so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion.... The"
"246";"2";"73";"sailors’ eyes were blue and grey and even black. The only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who"
"247";"2";"74";"amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:"
"248";"2";"75";"“All right! All right!"""
"249";"2";"76";"When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the"
"250";"2";"77";"grocers’ shops musty biscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered"
"251";"2";"78";"through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went into a"
"252";"2";"79";"huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the"
"253";"2";"80";"cat escaped into a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank"
"254";"2";"81";"over the ridge of which we could see the Dodder."
"255";"2";"82";"It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before"
"256";"2";"83";"four o’clock lest our adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and I had to suggest going"
"257";"2";"84";"home by train before he regained any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and"
"258";"2";"85";"the crumbs of our provisions."
"259";"2";"86";"There was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking I saw a man"
"260";"2";"87";"approaching from the far end of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell"
"261";"2";"88";"fortunes. He came along by the bank slowly. He walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick with"
"262";"2";"89";"which he tapped the turf lightly. He was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what we used to call a jerry"
"263";"2";"90";"hat with a high crown. He seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashen-grey. When he passed at our feet he glanced up"
"264";"2";"91";"at us quickly and then continued his way. We followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty"
"265";"2";"92";"paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps. He walked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with his"
"266";"2";"93";"stick, so slowly that I thought he was looking for something in the grass."
"267";"2";"94";"He stopped when he came level with us and bade us goodday. We answered him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly"
"268";"2";"95";"and with great care. He began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons"
"269";"2";"96";"had changed gready since he was a boy - a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one’s life was undoubtedly one’s"
"270";"2";"97";"schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be young again. While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a"
"271";"2";"98";"little we kept silent. Then he began to talk of school and of books. He asked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas"
"272";"2";"99";"Moore or the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton. I pretended that I had read every book he mentioned so that in the"
"273";"2";"100";"end he said:"
"274";"2";"101";"“Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself. Now,"" he added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes,"
"275";"2";"102";"“he is different; he goes in for games."""
"276";"2";"103";"He said he had all Sir Walter Scott’s works and all Lord Lytton’s works at home and never tired of reading them. “Of"
"277";"2";"104";"course,"" he said, “there were some of Lord Lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read."" Mahony asked why couldn’t boys read"
"278";"2";"105";"them - a question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The man,"
"279";"2";"106";"however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had"
"280";"2";"107";"the most sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. The man asked me how many I had. I answered that I"
"281";"2";"108";"had none. He did not believe me and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent."
"282";"2";"109";"“Tell us,"" said Mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?"""
"283";"2";"110";"The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts."
"284";"2";"111";"“Every boy,"" he said, “has a little sweetheart."""
"285";"2";"112";"His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age. In my heart I thought that what he said"
"286";"2";"113";"about boys and sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or"
"287";"2";"114";"twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He began to"
"288";"2";"115";"speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so"
"289";"2";"116";"good as they seemed to be if one only knew. There was nothing he liked, he said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at"
"290";"2";"117";"her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair. He gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had"
"291";"2";"118";"learned by heart or that, magnetised by some words of his own speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in the"
"292";"2";"119";"same orbit. At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his"
"293";"2";"120";"voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not wish others to overhear. He repeated"
"294";"2";"121";"his phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice. I continued to gaze towards"
"295";"2";"122";"the foot of the slope, listening to him."
"296";"2";"123";"After a long while his monologue paused. He stood up slowly, saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few"
"297";"2";"124";"minutes, and, without changing the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the"
"298";"2";"125";"field. We remained silent when he had gone. After a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:"
"299";"2";"126";"“I say! Look what he’s doing!"""
"300";"2";"127";"As I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:"
"301";"2";"128";"“I say... He’s a queer old josser!"""
"302";"2";"129";"“In case he asks us for our names,"" I said “let you be Murphy and I’ll be Smith."""
"303";"2";"130";"We said nothing further to each other. I was still considering whether I would go away or not when the man came back and"
"304";"2";"131";"sat down beside us again. Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and"
"305";"2";"132";"pursued her across the field. The man and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began to throw stones at"
"306";"2";"133";"the wall she had escaladed. Desisting from this, he began to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly."
"307";"2";"134";"After an interval the man spoke to me. He said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at"
"308";"2";"135";"school. I was going to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be whipped, as he called it; but I"
"309";"2";"136";"remained silent. He began to speak on the subject of chastising boys. His mind, as if magnetised again by his speech, seemed"
"310";"2";"137";"to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He said that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well"
"311";"2";"138";"whipped. When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the"
"312";"2";"139";"hand or a box on the ear was no good: what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping. I was surprised at this sentiment and"
"313";"2";"140";"involuntarily glanced up at his face. As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a"
"314";"2";"141";"twitching forehead. I turned my eyes away again."
"315";"2";"142";"The man continued his monologue. He seemed to have forgotten his recent liberalism. He said that if ever he found a boy"
"316";"2";"143";"talking to girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that would teach him not to be"
"317";"2";"144";"talking to girls. And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as"
"318";"2";"145";"no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to"
"319";"2";"146";"me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery. He would love that, he said, better than"
"320";"2";"147";"anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to"
"321";"2";"148";"plead with me that I should understand him."
"322";"2";"149";"I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few"
"323";"2";"150";"moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the"
"324";"2";"151";"slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top of the"
"325";"2";"152";"slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field:"
"326";"2";"153";"“Murphy!"""
"327";"2";"154";"My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again"
"328";"2";"155";"before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! He ran as if to"
"329";"2";"156";"bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him a little."
"330";"3";"2";"The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed,"
"331";"3";"3";"hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few"
"332";"3";"4";"paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communnicant and The"
"333";"3";"5";"Memoirs of Vidocq. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a"
"334";"3";"6";"central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been"
"335";"3";"7";"a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his"
"336";"3";"8";"sister."
"337";"3";"9";"When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses"
"338";"3";"10";"had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street"
"339";"3";"11";"lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent"
"340";"3";"12";"street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the"
"341";"3";"13";"rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the"
"342";"3";"14";"dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we"
"343";"3";"15";"returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid"
"344";"3";"16";"in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to"
"345";"3";"17";"his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and,"
"346";"3";"18";"if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined"
"347";"3";"19";"by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking"
"348";"3";"20";"at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side."
"349";"3";"21";"Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of"
"350";"3";"22";"the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books"
"351";"3";"23";"and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I"
"352";"3";"24";"quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual"
"353";"3";"25";"words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood."
"354";"3";"26";"Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I"
"355";"3";"27";"had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women,"
"356";"3";"28";"amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’ cheeks, the nasal"
"357";"3";"29";"chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native"
"358";"3";"30";"land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng"
"359";"3";"31";"of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes"
"360";"3";"32";"were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom."
"361";"3";"33";"I thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could"
"362";"3";"34";"tell her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the"
"363";"3";"35";"wires."
"364";"3";"36";"One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no"
"365";"3";"37";"sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of"
"366";"3";"38";"water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so"
"367";"3";"39";"little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the"
"368";"3";"40";"palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: “O love! O love!"" many times."
"369";"3";"41";"At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer."
"370";"3";"42";"She asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said she would"
"371";"3";"43";"love to go."
"372";"3";"44";"“And why can’t you?"" I asked."
"373";"3";"45";"While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would"
"374";"3";"46";"be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the"
"375";"3";"47";"railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white"
"376";"3";"48";"curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side"
"377";"3";"49";"of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease."
"378";"3";"50";"“It’s well for you,"" she said."
"379";"3";"51";"“If I go,"" I said, “I will bring you something."""
"380";"3";"52";"What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the"
"381";"3";"53";"tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image"
"382";"3";"54";"came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in"
"383";"3";"55";"which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night."
"384";"3";"56";"My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master’s"
"385";"3";"57";"face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts"
"386";"3";"58";"together. I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed"
"387";"3";"59";"to me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play."
"388";"3";"60";"On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the"
"389";"3";"61";"hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:"
"390";"3";"62";"“Yes, boy, I know."""
"391";"3";"63";"As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window. I left the house in bad humour and"
"392";"3";"64";"walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me."
"393";"3";"65";"When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time"
"394";"3";"66";"and. when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house."
"395";"3";"67";"The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my"
"396";"3";"68";"companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the"
"397";"3";"69";"cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the"
"398";"3";"70";"brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the"
"399";"3";"71";"railings and at the border below the dress."
"400";"3";"72";"When I came downstairs again I found Mrs. Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s"
"401";"3";"73";"widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged"
"402";"3";"74";"beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs. Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any longer, but"
"403";"3";"75";"it was after eight o’clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began"
"404";"3";"76";"to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said:"
"405";"3";"77";"“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord."""
"406";"3";"78";"At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand"
"407";"3";"79";"rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his"
"408";"3";"80";"dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten."
"409";"3";"81";"“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,"" he said."
"410";"3";"82";"I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:"
"411";"3";"83";"“Can’t you give him the money and let him go? You’ve kept him late enough as it is."""
"412";"3";"84";"My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack"
"413";"3";"85";"a dull boy."" He asked me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me did I know The Arab’s Farewell"
"414";"3";"86";"to his Steed. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt."
"415";"3";"87";"I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets"
"416";"3";"88";"thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage"
"417";"3";"89";"of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous"
"418";"3";"90";"house and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters"
"419";"3";"91";"moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes"
"420";"3";"92";"the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock"
"421";"3";"93";"that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name."
"422";"3";"94";"I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a"
"423";"3";"95";"turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man. I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery."
"424";"3";"96";"Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness. I recognised a silence like that which"
"425";"3";"97";"pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly. A few people were gathered about the"
"426";"3";"98";"stalls which were still open. Before a curtain, over which the words Cafe Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men"
"427";"3";"99";"were counting money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins."
"428";"3";"100";"Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea"
"429";"3";"101";"- sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English"
"430";"3";"102";"accents and listened vaguely to their conversation."
"431";"3";"103";"“O, I never said such a thing!"""
"432";"3";"104";"“O, but you did!"""
"433";"3";"105";"“O, but I didn’t!"""
"434";"3";"106";"“Didn’t she say that?"""
"435";"3";"107";"“Yes. I heard her."""
"436";"3";"108";"“0, there’s a ... fib!"""
"437";"3";"109";"Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging;"
"438";"3";"110";"she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at"
"439";"3";"111";"either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:"
"440";"3";"112";"“No, thank you."""
"441";"3";"113";"The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the"
"442";"3";"114";"same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder."
"443";"3";"115";"I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then"
"444";"3";"116";"I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my"
"445";"3";"117";"pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now"
"446";"3";"118";"completely dark."
"447";"3";"119";"Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and"
"448";"3";"120";"anger."
"449";"4";"2";"Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the"
"450";"4";"3";"concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field"
"451";"4";"4";"there in which they used to play every evening with other people’s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and"
"452";"4";"5";"built houses in it - not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the"
"453";"4";"6";"avenue used to play together in that field - the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her"
"454";"4";"7";"brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the"
"455";"4";"8";"field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still"
"456";"4";"9";"they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a"
"457";"4";"10";"long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the"
"458";"4";"11";"Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home."
"459";"4";"12";"Home! She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years,"
"460";"4";"13";"wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had"
"461";"4";"14";"never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose"
"462";"4";"15";"yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed"
"463";"4";"16";"Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend of her father. Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father"
"464";"4";"17";"used to pass it with a casual word:"
"465";"4";"18";"“He is in Melbourne now."""
"466";"4";"19";"She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home"
"467";"4";"20";"anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her. O course she had to work hard,"
"468";"4";"21";"both in the house and at business. What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with a"
"469";"4";"22";"fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had"
"470";"4";"23";"always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people listening."
"471";"4";"24";"“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?"""
"472";"4";"25";"“Look lively, Miss Hill, please."""
"473";"4";"26";"She would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores."
"474";"4";"27";"But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that. Then she would be married - she, Eveline."
"475";"4";"28";"People would treat her with respect then. She would not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she was over"
"476";"4";"29";"nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father’s violence. She knew it was that that had given her the"
"477";"4";"30";"palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a"
"478";"4";"31";"girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother’s sake. And no she"
"479";"4";"32";"had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down"
"480";"4";"33";"somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably."
"481";"4";"34";"She always gave her entire wages - seven shillings - and Harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any"
"482";"4";"35";"money from her father. He said she used to squander the money, that she had no head, that he wasn’t going to give her his"
"483";"4";"36";"hard-earned money to throw about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad on Saturday night. In the end he"
"484";"4";"37";"would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner. Then she had to rush out as quickly as"
"485";"4";"38";"she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the"
"486";"4";"39";"crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and to see that"
"487";"4";"40";"the two young children who had been left to hr charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was hard"
"488";"4";"41";"work - a hard life - but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life."
"489";"4";"42";"She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him"
"490";"4";"43";"by the night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she"
"491";"4";"44";"remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a"
"492";"4";"45";"few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face"
"493";"4";"46";"of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He"
"494";"4";"47";"took her to see The Bohemian Girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was"
"495";"4";"48";"awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a"
"496";"4";"49";"sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement"
"497";"4";"50";"for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy"
"498";"4";"51";"at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada. He told her the names of the ships he had been on and"
"499";"4";"52";"the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible"
"500";"4";"53";"Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of"
"501";"4";"54";"course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him."
"502";"4";"55";"“I know these sailor chaps,"" he said."
"503";"4";"56";"One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly."
"504";"4";"57";"The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was"
"505";"4";"58";"to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he"
"506";"4";"59";"would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a"
"507";"4";"60";"ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to"
"508";"4";"61";"the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mothers bonnet to make the children laugh."
"509";"4";"62";"Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling"
"510";"4";"63";"the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air Strange that it"
"511";"4";"64";"should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she"
"512";"4";"65";"could. She remembered the last night of her mother’s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the"
"513";"4";"66";"hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She"
"514";"4";"67";"remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:"
"515";"4";"68";"“Damned Italians! coming over here!"""
"516";"4";"69";"As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on the very quick of her being - that life of"
"517";"4";"70";"commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice saying constantly with"
"518";"4";"71";"foolish insistence:"
"519";"4";"72";"“Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!"""
"520";"4";"73";"She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life,"
"521";"4";"74";"perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in"
"522";"4";"75";"his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her."
"523";"4";"76";"She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to"
"524";"4";"77";"her, saying something about the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through"
"525";"4";"78";"the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with"
"526";"4";"79";"illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to"
"527";"4";"80";"God to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow"
"528";"4";"81";"she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back"
"529";"4";"82";"after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent"
"530";"4";"83";"prayer."
"531";"4";"84";"A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:"
"532";"4";"85";"“Come!"""
"533";"4";"86";"All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with"
"534";"4";"87";"both hands at the iron railing."
"535";"4";"88";"“Come!"""
"536";"4";"89";"No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish."
"537";"4";"90";"“Eveline! Evvy!"""
"538";"4";"91";"He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set"
"539";"4";"92";"her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition."
"540";"5";"2";"The French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished solidly; they had been placed second and third and"
"541";"5";"3";"the driver of the winning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome"
"542";"5";"4";"as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car. In"
"543";"5";"5";"one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of"
"544";"5";"6";"successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious. They were Charles Segouin, the owner of the car;"
"545";"5";"7";"Andre Riviere, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly groomed young man named"
"546";"5";"8";"Doyle. Segouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he was about to start a motor"
"547";"5";"9";"establishment in Paris) and Riviere was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment; these"
"548";"5";"10";"two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good"
"549";"5";"11";"humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the"
"550";"5";"12";"party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy."
"551";"5";"13";"He was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes. His"
"552";"5";"14";"father, who had begun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early. He had made his money as a butcher in"
"553";"5";"15";"Kingstown and by opening shops in Dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over. He had also been"
"554";"5";"16";"fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the"
"555";"5";"17";"Dublin newspapers as a merchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be educated in a big Catholic college and had"
"556";"5";"18";"afterwards sent him to Dublin University to study law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a"
"557";"5";"19";"while. He had money and he was popular; and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles. Then he had"
"558";"5";"20";"been sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life. His father, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had"
"559";"5";"21";"paid his bills and brought him home. It was at Cambridge that he had met Segouin. They were not much more than acquaintances"
"560";"5";"22";"as yet but Jimmy found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of"
"561";"5";"23";"the biggest hotels in France. Such a person (as his father agreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had not been the"
"562";"5";"24";"charming companion he was. Villona was entertaining also - a brilliant pianist - but, unfortunately, very poor."
"563";"5";"25";"The car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two cousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian"
"564";"5";"26";"friend sat behind. Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road"
"565";"5";"27";"The Frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had to strain forward to catch the"
"566";"5";"28";"quick phrase. This was not altogether pleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and"
"567";"5";"29";"shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind. Besides Villona’s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the"
"568";"5";"30";"car, too."
"569";"5";"31";"Rapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does the possession of money. These were three good reasons"
"570";"5";"32";"for Jimmy’s excitement. He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these Continentals. At the"
"571";"5";"33";"control Segouin had presented him to one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur of compliment, the"
"572";"5";"34";"swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the"
"573";"5";"35";"profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks. Then as to money - he really had a great sum under his"
"574";"5";"36";"control. Segouin, perhaps, would not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary errors, was at heart the"
"575";"5";"37";"inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together. This knowledge had previously kept his"
"576";"5";"38";"bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness, and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there"
"577";"5";"39";"had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more so now when he was about to stake the"
"578";"5";"40";"greater part of his substance! It was a serious thing for him."
"579";"5";"41";"Of course, the investment was a good one and Segouin had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of"
"580";"5";"42";"friendship the mite of Irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern. Jimmy had a respect for his father’s"
"581";"5";"43";"shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment; money to be"
"582";"5";"44";"made in the motor business, pots of money. Moreover Segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate"
"583";"5";"45";"into days’ work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In what style they had come careering along the"
"584";"5";"46";"country roads! The journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves"
"585";"5";"47";"strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal."
"586";"5";"48";"They drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of"
"587";"5";"49";"impatient tram-drivers. Near the Bank Segouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend alighted. A little knot of people collected"
"588";"5";"50";"on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor. The party was to dine together that evening in Segouin’s hotel and,"
"589";"5";"51";"meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who was staying with him, were to go home to dress. The car steered out slowly for Grafton"
"590";"5";"52";"Street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers. They walked northward with a curious feeling of"
"591";"5";"53";"disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening."
"592";"5";"54";"In Jimmy’s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. A certain pride mingled with his parents’ trepidation, a"
"593";"5";"55";"certain eagerness, also, to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue. Jimmy, too,"
"594";"5";"56";"looked very well when he was dressed and, as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie, his"
"595";"5";"57";"father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable. His father,"
"596";"5";"58";"therefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this"
"597";"5";"59";"subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner."
"598";"5";"60";"The dinner was excellent, exquisite. Segouin, Jimmy decided, had a very refined taste. The party was increased by a young"
"599";"5";"61";"Englishman named Routh whom Jimmy had seen with Segouin at Cambridge. The young men supped in a snug room lit by electric"
"600";"5";"62";"candle lamps. They talked volubly and with little reserve. Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the lively youth"
"601";"5";"63";"of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the Englishman’s manner. A graceful image of his, he thought,"
"602";"5";"64";"and a just one. He admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation. The five young men had various"
"603";"5";"65";"tastes and their tongues had been loosened. Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to the mildly surprised"
"604";"5";"66";"Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal, deploring the loss of old instruments. Riviere, not wholly ingenuously,"
"605";"5";"67";"undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to"
"606";"5";"68";"prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when Segouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was"
"607";"5";"69";"congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him: he"
"608";"5";"70";"aroused the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly hot and Segouin’s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger"
"609";"5";"71";"of personal spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he"
"610";"5";"72";"threw open a window significantly."
"611";"5";"73";"That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen’s Green in a faint cloud of"
"612";"5";"74";"aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At"
"613";"5";"75";"the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car"
"614";"5";"76";"drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party."
"615";"5";"77";"“Andre."""
"616";"5";"78";"“It’s Farley!"""
"617";"5";"79";"A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Riviere"
"618";"5";"80";"were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter."
"619";"5";"81";"They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. They took the train at Westland Row and"
"620";"5";"82";"in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he"
"621";"5";"83";"was an old man:"
"622";"5";"84";"“Fine night, sir!"""
"623";"5";"85";"It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked"
"624";"5";"86";"arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:"
"625";"5";"87";"“Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment!"""
"626";"5";"88";"They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American’s yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards. Villona"
"627";"5";"89";"said with conviction:"
"628";"5";"90";"“It is delightful!"""
"629";"5";"91";"There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and"
"630";"5";"92";"Riviere as lady. Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his part with"
"631";"5";"93";"a will; this was seeing life, at least. Then Farley got out of breath and cried “Stop!"" A man brought in a light supper, and"
"632";"5";"94";"the young men sat down to it for form’s sake. They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France,"
"633";"5";"95";"Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: “Hear! hear!"" whenever there was"
"634";"5";"96";"a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down. It must have been a good speech. Farley clapped him on the"
"635";"5";"97";"back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were!"
"636";"5";"98";"Cards! cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them. The other men"
"637";"5";"99";"played game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure. They drank the health of the Queen of Hearts and of"
"638";"5";"100";"the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing. Play ran very high and paper"
"639";"5";"101";"began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing. But it was his own fault for he"
"640";"5";"102";"frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his I.O.U.""˜s for him. They were devils of fellows but he"
"641";"5";"103";"wished they would stop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht The Belle of Newport and then someone"
"642";"5";"104";"proposed one great game for a finish."
"643";"5";"105";"The piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck. It was a terrible game. They stopped just before the end of it"
"644";"5";"106";"to drink for luck. Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Segouin. What excitement! Jimmy was excited too; he"
"645";"5";"107";"would lose, of course. How much had he written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks. talking and"
"646";"5";"108";"gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the young men’s cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began then"
"647";"5";"109";"to gather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers."
"648";"5";"110";"He knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would"
"649";"5";"111";"cover up his folly. He leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands, counting the beats of his"
"650";"5";"112";"temples. The cabin door opened and he saw the Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:"
"651";"5";"113";"“Daybreak, gentlemen!"""
"652";"6";"2";"Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. On of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close. The other,"
"653";"6";"3";"who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to his companion’s rudeness, wore"
"654";"6";"4";"an amused listening face. He was squat and ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to"
"655";"6";"5";"which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and"
"656";"6";"6";"mouth. Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning"
"657";"6";"7";"enjoyment, glanced at every moment towards his companion’s face. Once or twice he rearranged the light waterproof which he"
"658";"6";"8";"had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof"
"659";"6";"9";"expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves"
"660";"6";"10";"of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look."
"661";"6";"11";"When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:"
"662";"6";"12";"“Well!... That takes the biscuit!"""
"663";"6";"13";"His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added with humour:"
"664";"6";"14";"“That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, recherche biscuit! """
"665";"6";"15";"He became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a"
"666";"6";"16";"public-house in Dorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and"
"667";"6";"17";"eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave manner of coming up"
"668";"6";"18";"to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round. He"
"669";"6";"19";"was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of"
"670";"6";"20";"discourtesy. No one knew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely associated with racing"
"671";"6";"21";"tissues."
"672";"6";"22";"“And where did you pick her up, Corley?"" he asked."
"673";"6";"23";"Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip."
"674";"6";"24";"“One night, man,"" he said, “I was going along Dame Street and I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse’s clock and said"
"675";"6";"25";"good-night, you know. So we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey in a house in Baggot Street."
"676";"6";"26";"I put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We vent out to"
"677";"6";"27";"Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told me she used to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man. Cigarettes"
"678";"6";"28";"every night she’d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars - O, the"
"679";"6";"29";"real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she’d get in the family way. But she’s up to"
"680";"6";"30";"the dodge."""
"681";"6";"31";"“Maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,"" said Lenehan."
"682";"6";"32";"“I told her I was out of a job,"" said Corley. “I told her I was in Pim’s. She doesn’t know my name. I was too hairy to"
"683";"6";"33";"tell her that. But she thinks I’m a bit of class, you know."""
"684";"6";"34";"Lenehan laughed again, noiselessly."
"685";"6";"35";"“Of all the good ones ever I heard,"" he said, “that emphatically takes the biscuit."""
"686";"6";"36";"Corley’s stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from"
"687";"6";"37";"the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father’s frame"
"688";"6";"38";"and gut. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was"
"689";"6";"39";"large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb"
"690";"6";"40";"which had grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze"
"691";"6";"41";"after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever"
"692";"6";"42";"any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in"
"693";"6";"43";"plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke"
"694";"6";"44";"without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a"
"695";"6";"45";"person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he"
"696";"6";"46";"aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines."
"697";"6";"47";"Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to"
"698";"6";"48";"smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He"
"699";"6";"49";"watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said:"
"700";"6";"50";"“Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all right, eh?"""
"701";"6";"51";"Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer."
"702";"6";"52";"“Is she game for that?"" asked Lenehan dubiously. “You can never know women."""
"703";"6";"53";"“She’s all right,"" said Corley. “I know the way to get around her, man. She’s a bit gone on me."""
"704";"6";"54";"“You’re what I call a gay Lothario,"" said Lenehan. “And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!"""
"705";"6";"55";"A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to"
"706";"6";"56";"the interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind."
"707";"6";"57";"“There’s nothing to touch a good slavey,"" he affirmed. “Take my tip for it."""
"708";"6";"58";"“By one who has tried them all,"" said Lenehan."
"709";"6";"59";"“First I used to go with girls, you know,"" said Corley, unbosoming; “girls off the South Circular. I used to take them"
"710";"6";"60";"out, man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and"
"711";"6";"61";"sweets or something that way. I used to spend money on them right enough,"" he added, in a convincing tone, as if he was"
"712";"6";"62";"conscious of being disbelieved."
"713";"6";"63";"But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely."
"714";"6";"64";"“I know that game,"" he said, “and it’s a mug’s game."""
"715";"6";"65";"“And damn the thing I ever got out of it,"" said Corley."
"716";"6";"66";"“Ditto here,"" said Lenehan."
"717";"6";"67";"“Only off of one of them,"" said Corley."
"718";"6";"68";"He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The recollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale"
"719";"6";"69";"disc of the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate."
"720";"6";"70";"She was... a bit of all right,"" he said regretfully."
"721";"6";"71";"He was silent again. Then he added:"
"722";"6";"72";"“She’s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night with two fellows with her on a car."""
"723";"6";"73";"“I suppose that’s your doing,"" said Lenehan."
"724";"6";"74";"“There was others at her before me,"" said Corley philosophically."
"725";"6";"75";"This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and fro and smiled."
"726";"6";"76";"“You know you can’t kid me, Corley,"" he said."
"727";"6";"77";"“Honest to God!"" said Corley. “Didn’t she tell me herself?"""
"728";"6";"78";"Lenehan made a tragic gesture."
"729";"6";"79";"“Base betrayer!"" he said."
"730";"6";"80";"As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock."
"731";"6";"81";"“Twenty after,"" he said."
"732";"6";"82";"“Time enough,"" said Corley. “She’ll be there all right. I always let her wait a bit."""
"733";"6";"83";"Lenehan laughed quietly."
"734";"6";"84";"""˜Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,"" he said."
"735";"6";"85";"“I’m up to all their little tricks,"" Corley confessed."
"736";"6";"86";"“But tell me,"" said Lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off all right? You know it’s a ticklish job. They’re"
"737";"6";"87";"damn close on that point. Eh? ... What?"""
"738";"6";"88";"His bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance. Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss"
"739";"6";"89";"aside an insistent insect, and his brows gathered."
"740";"6";"90";"“I’ll pull it off,"" he said. “Leave it to me, can’t you?"""
"741";"6";"91";"Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was"
"742";"6";"92";"not wanted. A little tact was necessary. But Corley’s brow was soon smooth again. His thoughts were running another way."
"743";"6";"93";"“She’s a fine decent tart,"" he said, with appreciation; “that’s what she is."""
"744";"6";"94";"They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street. Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood"
"745";"6";"95";"in the roadway, playing to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to"
"746";"6";"96";"time at the face of each new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless that her"
"747";"6";"97";"coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master’s hands. One hand played"
"748";"6";"98";"in the bass the melody of Silent, O Moyle, while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes. The notes"
"749";"6";"99";"of the air sounded deep and full."
"750";"6";"100";"The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful music following them. When they reached Stephen’s"
"751";"6";"101";"Green they crossed the road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them from their silence."
"752";"6";"102";"“There she is!"" said Corley."
"753";"6";"103";"At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the"
"754";"6";"104";"curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively."
"755";"6";"105";"“Let’s have a look at her, Corley,"" he said."
"756";"6";"106";"Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face."
"757";"6";"107";"“Are you trying to get inside me?"" he asked."
"758";"6";"108";"“Damn it!"" said Lenehan boldly, “I don’t want an introduction. All I want is to have a look at her. I’m not going to eat"
"759";"6";"109";"her."""
"760";"6";"110";"“O ... A look at her?"" said Corley, more amiably. “Well... I’ll tell you what. I’ll go over and talk to her and you can"
"761";"6";"111";"pass by."""
"762";"6";"112";"“Right!"" said Lenehan."
"763";"6";"113";"Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called out:"
"764";"6";"114";"“And after? Where will we meet?"""
"765";"6";"115";"“Half ten,"" answered Corley, bringing over his other leg."
"766";"6";"116";"“Where?"""
"767";"6";"117";"“Corner of Merrion Street. We’ll be coming back."""
"768";"6";"118";"“Work it all right now,"" said Lenehan in farewell."
"769";"6";"119";"Corley did not answer. He sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side. His bulk, his easy pace, and the"
"770";"6";"120";"solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young woman and, without saluting, began"
"771";"6";"121";"at once to converse with her. She swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels. Once or twice when"
"772";"6";"122";"he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head."
"773";"6";"123";"Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the"
"774";"6";"124";"road obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious"
"775";"6";"125";"scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance. She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt"
"776";"6";"126";"of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of"
"777";"6";"127";"her white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of"
"778";"6";"128";"her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom stems upwards."
"779";"6";"129";"Lenehan’s eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body. rank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks"
"780";"6";"130";"and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a"
"781";"6";"131";"contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he passed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley"
"782";"6";"132";"returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his"
"783";"6";"133";"hat."
"784";"6";"134";"Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and waited. After waiting for a little time he saw them"
"785";"6";"135";"coming towards him and, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly in his white shoes, down one side"
"786";"6";"136";"of Merrion Square. As he walked on slowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley’s head which turned at every moment"
"787";"6";"137";"towards the young woman’s face like a big ball revolving on a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen them"
"788";"6";"138";"climbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and went back the way he had come."
"789";"6";"139";"Now that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety seemed to forsake him and, as he came by the railings of the"
"790";"6";"140";"Duke’s Lawn, he allowed his hand to run along them. The air which the harpist had played began to control his movements His"
"791";"6";"141";"softly padded feet played the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group"
"792";"6";"142";"of notes."
"793";"6";"143";"He walked listlessly round Stephen’s Green and then down Grafton Street. Though his eyes took note of many elements of"
"794";"6";"144";"the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely. He found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not answer"
"795";"6";"145";"the glances which invited him to be bold. He knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to amuse and his"
"796";"6";"146";"brain and throat were too dry for such a task. The problem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again troubled"
"797";"6";"147";"him a little. He could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking. He turned to the left when he came to the"
"798";"6";"148";"corner of Rutland Square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the sombre look of which suited his mood. He paused"
"799";"6";"149";"at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which the words Refreshment Bar were printed in white letters. On the"
"800";"6";"150";"glass of the window were two flying inscriptions: Ginger Beer and Ginger Ale. A cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish"
"801";"6";"151";"while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding. He eyed this food earnestly for some time and then, after"
"802";"6";"152";"glancing warily up and down the street, went into the shop quickly."
"803";"6";"153";"He was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging curates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since"
"804";"6";"154";"breakfast-time. He sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a mechanic. A slatternly girl waited on"
"805";"6";"155";"him."
"806";"6";"156";"“How much is a plate of peas?"" he asked."
"807";"6";"157";"“Three halfpence, sir,"" said the girl."
"808";"6";"158";"“Bring me a plate of peas,"" he said, “and a bottle of ginger beer."""
"809";"6";"159";"He spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry had been followed by a pause of talk. His face was"
"810";"6";"160";"heated. To appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table. The mechanic and the two"
"811";"6";"161";"work-girls examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. The girl brought him a plate"
"812";"6";"162";"of grocer’s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a fork and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found it so"
"813";"6";"163";"good that he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some"
"814";"6";"164";"time thinking of Corley’s adventure. In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road; he heard"
"815";"6";"165";"Corley’s voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth. This vision made him feel"
"816";"6";"166";"keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was tired of knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and"
"817";"6";"167";"intrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he never get a good job? Would he never have a home of his own? He"
"818";"6";"168";"thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to. He had walked the streets"
"819";"6";"169";"long enough with friends and with girls. He knew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls too. Experience had"
"820";"6";"170";"embittered his heart against the world. But all hope had not left him. He felt better after having eaten than he had felt"
"821";"6";"171";"before, less weary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live"
"822";"6";"172";"happily if he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready."
"823";"6";"173";"He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again. He went into"
"824";"6";"174";"Capel Street and walked along towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the corner of George’s Street he"
"825";"6";"175";"met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his walking. His friends"
"826";"6";"176";"asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest. He replied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends talked"
"827";"6";"177";"very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had"
"828";"6";"178";"seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he had been with Mac the night before in Egan’s."
"829";"6";"179";"The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard match."
"830";"6";"180";"Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood them drinks in Egan’s."
"831";"6";"181";"He left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George’s Street. He turned to the left at the City Markets and walked"
"832";"6";"182";"on into Grafton Street. The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and"
"833";"6";"183";"couples bidding one another good-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten."
"834";"6";"184";"He set off briskly along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he reached the"
"835";"6";"185";"corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had"
"836";"6";"186";"reserved and lit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see"
"837";"6";"187";"Corley and the young woman return."
"838";"6";"188";"His mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if"
"839";"6";"189";"he would leave it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s situation as well as those of his own."
"840";"6";"190";"But the memory of Corley’s slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off all right. All at"
"841";"6";"191";"once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip. His eyes searched the"
"842";"6";"192";"street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons."
"843";"6";"193";"Would Corley do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously. He strained his eyes as each"
"844";"6";"194";"tram stopped at the far corner of the square. They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his cigarette broke and"
"845";"6";"195";"he flung it into the road with a curse."
"846";"6";"196";"Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and keeping close to his lamp-post tried to read the"
"847";"6";"197";"result in their walk. They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps, while Corley kept beside her with"
"848";"6";"198";"his long stride. They did not seem to be speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp"
"849";"6";"199";"instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go."
"850";"6";"200";"They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the other footpath. When they stopped he stopped too."
"851";"6";"201";"They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house. Corley remained"
"852";"6";"202";"standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened"
"853";"6";"203";"slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad"
"854";"6";"204";"figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps. The door closed on her and Corley"
"855";"6";"205";"began to walk swiftly towards Stephen’s Green."
"856";"6";"206";"Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back"
"857";"6";"207";"towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road. Anxiety"
"858";"6";"208";"and his swift run made him pant. He called out:"
"859";"6";"209";"“Hallo, Corley!"""
"860";"6";"210";"Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling"
"861";"6";"211";"the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand."
"862";"6";"212";"“Hallo, Corley!"" he cried again."
"863";"6";"213";"He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could see nothing there."
"864";"6";"214";"“Well?"" he said. “Did it come off?"""
"865";"6";"215";"They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side"
"866";"6";"216";"street. His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a"
"867";"6";"217";"note of menace pierced through his voice."
"868";"6";"218";"“Can’t you tell us?"" he said. “Did you try her?"""
"869";"6";"219";"Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the"
"870";"6";"220";"light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone in the palm."
"871";"7";"2";"After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. She would"
"872";"7";"3";"give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff’s man. He was a shabby"
"873";"7";"4";"stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were"
"874";"7";"5";"veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs. Mooney, who had taken what"
"875";"7";"6";"remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman."
"876";"7";"7";"Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, artistes from"
"877";"7";"8";"the music halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed the house cunningly and firmly,"
"878";"7";"9";"knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as The"
"879";"7";"10";"Madam."
"880";"7";"11";"Mrs. Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They"
"881";"7";"12";"shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They discussed with one"
"882";"7";"13";"another the chances of favourites and outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet"
"883";"7";"14";"Street, had the reputation of being a hard case. He was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home in the"
"884";"7";"15";"small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good"
"885";"7";"16";"thing-that is to say, a likely horse or a likely artiste. He was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday"
"886";"7";"17";"nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs. Mooney’s front drawing-room. The music-hall artistes would oblige; and"
"887";"7";"18";"Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter, would also sing. She"
"888";"7";"19";"sang:"
"889";"7";"20";"I’m a ... naughty girl."
"890";"7";"21";"You needn’t sham:"
"891";"7";"22";"You know I am."
"892";"7";"23";"Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade"
"893";"7";"24";"of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little"
"894";"7";"25";"perverse madonna. Mrs. Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a disreputable"
"895";"7";"26";"sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken"
"896";"7";"27";"her daughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the"
"897";"7";"28";"young men. Besides young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away. Polly, of course, flirted with the"
"898";"7";"29";"young men but Mrs. Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them"
"899";"7";"30";"meant business. Things went on so for a long time and Mrs. Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when"
"900";"7";"31";"she noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men. She watched the pair and kept her own"
"901";"7";"32";"counsel."
"902";"7";"33";"Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had"
"903";"7";"34";"been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of"
"904";"7";"35";"the affair, still Mrs. Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was"
"905";"7";"36";"evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs. Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral"
"906";"7";"37";"problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind."
"907";"7";"38";"It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the"
"908";"7";"39";"boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of"
"909";"7";"40";"George’s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church,"
"910";"7";"41";"revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands."
"911";"7";"42";"Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow"
"912";"7";"43";"streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. Mrs. Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and watched the servant"
"913";"7";"44";"Mary remove the breakfast things. She mad Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make Tuesday’s"
"914";"7";"45";"bread-pudding. When the table was cleared, the broken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she"
"915";"7";"46";"began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with Polly. Things were as she had suspected: she had"
"916";"7";"47";"been frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course. She had been"
"917";"7";"48";"made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been"
"918";"7";"49";"made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be"
"919";"7";"50";"thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s tolerance."
"920";"7";"51";"Mrs. Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her"
"921";"7";"52";"revery that the bells of George’s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of"
"922";"7";"53";"time to have the matter out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure she would win. To"
"923";"7";"54";"begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live"
"924";"7";"55";"beneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her hospitality. He was thirty-four or"
"925";"7";"56";"thirty-five years of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a"
"926";"7";"57";"man who had seen something of the world. He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth and inexperience: that was evident."
"927";"7";"58";"The question was: What reparation would he make?"
"928";"7";"59";"There must be reparation made in such case. It is all very well for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had"
"929";"7";"60";"happened, having had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers would be content to patch up"
"930";"7";"61";"such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation could"
"931";"7";"62";"make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage."
"932";"7";"63";"She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Doran’s room to say that she wished to speak with him. She felt"
"933";"7";"64";"sure she would win. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others. If it had been Mr. Sheridan or"
"934";"7";"65";"Mr. Meade or Bantam Lyons her task would have been much harder. She did not think he would face publicity. All the lodgers"
"935";"7";"66";"in the house knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some. Besides, he had been employed for thirteen"
"936";"7";"67";"years in a great Catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean for him, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if"
"937";"7";"68";"he agreed all might be well. She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by."
"938";"7";"69";"Nearly the half-hour! She stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid"
"939";"7";"70";"face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands."
"940";"7";"71";"Mr. Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so"
"941";"7";"72";"unsteady that he had been obliged to desist. Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a"
"942";"7";"73";"mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The recollection"
"943";"7";"74";"of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of"
"944";"7";"75";"the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation."
"945";"7";"76";"The harm was done. What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it out. The affair would be sure to"
"946";"7";"77";"be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else’s"
"947";"7";"78";"business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr. Leonard calling out in"
"948";"7";"79";"his rasping voice: “Send Mr. Doran here, please."""
"949";"7";"80";"All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and diligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown"
"950";"7";"81";"his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions in"
"951";"7";"82";"public-houses. But that was all passed and done with... nearly. He still bought a copy of Reynolds’s Newspaper every week"
"952";"7";"83";"but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle"
"953";"7";"84";"down on; it was not that. But the family would look down on her. First of all there was her disreputable father and then her"
"954";"7";"85";"mother’s boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had. He could imagine his"
"955";"7";"86";"friends talking of the affair and laughing. She was a little vulgar; some times she said “I seen"" and “If I had’ve known."""
"956";"7";"87";"But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for"
"957";"7";"88";"what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married"
"958";"7";"89";"you are done for, it said."
"959";"7";"90";"While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered."
"960";"7";"91";"She told him all, that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that"
"961";"7";"92";"morning. She cried and threw her arms round his neck, saying:"
"962";"7";"93";"“O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?"""
"963";"7";"94";"She would put an end to herself, she said."
"964";"7";"95";"He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear. He felt against his shirt the"
"965";"7";"96";"agitation of her bosom."
"966";"7";"97";"It was not altogether his fault that it had happened. He remembered well, with the curious patient memory of the"
"967";"7";"98";"celibate, the first casual caresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him. Then late one night as he was"
"968";"7";"99";"undressing for she had tapped at his door, timidly. She wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a"
"969";"7";"100";"gust. It was her bath night. She wore a loose open combing-jacket of printed flannel. Her white instep shone in the opening"
"970";"7";"101";"of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin. From her hands and wrists too as she lit and"
"971";"7";"102";"steadied her candle a faint perfume arose."
"972";"7";"103";"On nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner. He scarcely knew what he was eating feeling her"
"973";"7";"104";"beside him alone, at night, in the sleeping house. And her thoughtfulness! If the night was anyway cold or wet or windy"
"974";"7";"105";"there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him. Perhaps they could be happy together...."
"975";"7";"106";"They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on the third landing exchange reluctant goodnights."
"976";"7";"107";"They used to kiss. He remembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium...."
"977";"7";"108";"But delirium passes. He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself: “What am I to do?"" The instinct of the celibate warned"
"978";"7";"109";"him to hold back. But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that reparation must be made for such a sin."
"979";"7";"110";"While he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him in"
"980";"7";"111";"the parlour. He stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever. When he was dressed he went over to her"
"981";"7";"112";"to comfort her. It would be all right, never fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: “O my God!"""
"982";"7";"113";"Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them. He longed"
"983";"7";"114";"to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble, and yet a force"
"984";"7";"115";"pushed him downstairs step by step. The implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon his discomfiture. On"
"985";"7";"116";"the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of Bass. They saluted"
"986";"7";"117";"coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he"
"987";"7";"118";"reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of the return-room."
"988";"7";"119";"Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the musichall artistes, a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free"
"989";"7";"120";"allusion to Polly. The reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence. Everyone tried to quiet him. The"
"990";"7";"121";"music-hall artiste, a little paler than usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting"
"991";"7";"122";"at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so he"
"992";"7";"123";"would."
"993";"7";"124";"Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass."
"994";"7";"125";"She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water. She looked at herself in"
"995";"7";"126";"profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded the"
"996";"7";"127";"pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret, amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck"
"997";"7";"128";"against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her face."
"998";"7";"129";"She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm. her memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of"
"999";"7";"130";"the future. Her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or"
"1000";"7";"131";"remembered that she was waiting for anything."
"1001";"7";"132";"At last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran to the banisters."
"1002";"7";"133";"“Polly! Polly!"""
"1003";"7";"134";"“Yes, mamma?"""
"1004";"7";"135";"“Come down, dear. Mr. Doran wants to speak to you."""
"1005";"7";"136";"Then she remembered what she had been waiting for."
"1006";"8";"2";"Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of"
"1007";"8";"3";"the great city London where Gallaher lived. He was called Little Chandler because, though he was but slightly under the"
"1008";"8";"4";"average stature, he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame was fragile, his"
"1009";"8";"5";"voice was quiet and his manners were refined. He took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used"
"1010";"8";"6";"perfume discreetly on his handkerchief. The half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of"
"1011";"8";"7";"a row of childish white teeth."
"1012";"8";"8";"As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought what changes those eight years had brought. The friend whom he had"
"1013";"8";"9";"known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press. He turned often from his"
"1014";"8";"10";"tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks. It"
"1015";"8";"11";"cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon"
"1016";"8";"12";"all the moving figures - on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the"
"1017";"8";"13";"gardens. He watched the scene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he became sad. A gentle"
"1018";"8";"14";"melancholy took possession of him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of wisdom"
"1019";"8";"15";"which the ages had bequeathed to him."
"1020";"8";"16";"He remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home. He had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening,"
"1021";"8";"17";"as he sat in the little room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to"
"1022";"8";"18";"his wife. But shyness had always held him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves. At times he repeated lines"
"1023";"8";"19";"to himself and this consoled him."
"1024";"8";"20";"When his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously. He emerged from"
"1025";"8";"21";"under the feudal arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down Henrietta Street. The golden sunset"
"1026";"8";"22";"was waning and the air had grown sharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. They stood or ran in the roadway or"
"1027";"8";"23";"crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds. Little Chandler gave them no"
"1028";"8";"24";"thought. He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral"
"1029";"8";"25";"mansions in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered. No memory of the past touched him, for his mind was full of a"
"1030";"8";"26";"present joy."
"1031";"8";"27";"He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the value of the name. He knew that people went there after the theatre to eat"
"1032";"8";"28";"oysters and drink liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and German. Walking swiftly by at night he"
"1033";"8";"29";"had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly. They wore"
"1034";"8";"30";"noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth, like"
"1035";"8";"31";"alarmed Atalantas. He had always passed without turning his head to look. It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street"
"1036";"8";"32";"even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly."
"1037";"8";"33";"Sometimes, however, he courted the causes of his fear. He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked boldly"
"1038";"8";"34";"forward, the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures troubled him; and at"
"1039";"8";"35";"times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf."
"1040";"8";"36";"He turned to the right towards Capel Street. Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would have thought it possible"
"1041";"8";"37";"eight years before? Still, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in"
"1042";"8";"38";"his friend. People used to say that Ignatius Gallaher was wild Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that"
"1043";"8";"39";"time. drank freely and borrowed money on all sides. In the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money"
"1044";"8";"40";"transaction: at least, that was one version of his flight. But nobody denied him talent. There was always a certain..."
"1045";"8";"41";"something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself. Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits’ end"
"1046";"8";"42";"for money he kept up a bold face. Little Chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his"
"1047";"8";"43";"cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher’s sayings when he was in a tight corner:"
"1048";"8";"44";"“Half time now, boys,"" he used to say light-heartedly. “Where’s my considering cap?"""
"1049";"8";"45";"That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn’t but admire him for it."
"1050";"8";"46";"Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. For"
"1051";"8";"47";"the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to"
"1052";"8";"48";"succeed you had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the river towards"
"1053";"8";"49";"the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They seemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the"
"1054";"8";"50";"riverbanks, their old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill"
"1055";"8";"51";"of night bid them arise, shake themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea. Perhaps"
"1056";"8";"52";"Gallaher might be able to get it into some London paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not sure what"
"1057";"8";"53";"idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope. He"
"1058";"8";"54";"stepped onward bravely."
"1059";"8";"55";"Every step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober inartistic life. A light began to tremble on the"
"1060";"8";"56";"horizon of his mind. He was not so old - thirty-two. His temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity."
"1061";"8";"57";"There were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse. He felt them within him. He tried"
"1062";"8";"58";"weigh his soul to see if it was a poet’s soul. Melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it was a"
"1063";"8";"59";"melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy. If he could give expression to it in a book of"
"1064";"8";"60";"poems perhaps men would listen. He would never be popular: he saw that. He could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a"
"1065";"8";"61";"little circle of kindred minds. The English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one of the Celtic school by reason of"
"1066";"8";"62";"the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that, he would put in allusions. He began to invent sentences and phrases from the"
"1067";"8";"63";"notice which his book would get. “Mr. Chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse."" ... “wistful sadness pervades these"
"1068";"8";"64";"poems."" ... “The Celtic note."" It was a pity his name was not more Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his"
"1069";"8";"65";"mother’s name before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T. Malone Chandler. He would speak to Gallaher"
"1070";"8";"66";"about it."
"1071";"8";"67";"He pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back. As he came near Corless’s his former"
"1072";"8";"68";"agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision. Finally he opened the door and entered."
"1073";"8";"69";"The light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moments. He looked about him, but his sight was"
"1074";"8";"70";"confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses The bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the"
"1075";"8";"71";"people were observing him curiously. He glanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand appear"
"1076";"8";"72";"serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was"
"1077";"8";"73";"Ignatius Gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far apart."
"1078";"8";"74";"“Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you have? I’m taking whisky: better stuff than we get"
"1079";"8";"75";"across the water. Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I’m the same Spoils the flavour.... Here, garcon, bring us two halves of malt"
"1080";"8";"76";"whisky, like a good fellow.... Well, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear God, how old we’re"
"1081";"8";"77";"getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me - eh, what? A little grey and thin on the top - what?"""
"1082";"8";"78";"Ignatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head. His face was heavy, pale and cleanshaven."
"1083";"8";"79";"His eyes, which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie"
"1084";"8";"80";"he wore. Between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. He bent his head and felt"
"1085";"8";"81";"with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown. Little Chandler shook his head as a denial. Ignatius Galaher put on"
"1086";"8";"82";"his hat again."
"1087";"8";"83";"“It pulls you down,"" be said, “Press life. Always hurry and scurry, looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and"
"1088";"8";"84";"then, always to have something new in your stuff. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few days. I’m deuced glad, I can"
"1089";"8";"85";"tell you, to get back to the old country. Does a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I landed again"
"1090";"8";"86";"in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say when."""
"1091";"8";"87";"Little Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted."
"1092";"8";"88";"“You don’t know what’s good for you, my boy,"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “I drink mine neat."""
"1093";"8";"89";"“I drink very little as a rule,"" said Little Chandler modestly. “An odd half-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd:"
"1094";"8";"90";"that’s all."""
"1095";"8";"91";"“Ah well,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, “here’s to us and to old times and old acquaintance."""
"1096";"8";"92";"They clinked glasses and drank the toast."
"1097";"8";"93";"“I met some of the old gang today,"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “O’Hara seems to be in a bad way. What’s he doing?"""
"1098";"8";"94";"“Nothing, said Little Chandler. “He’s gone to the dogs."""
"1099";"8";"95";"“But Hogan has a good sit, hasn’t he?"""
"1100";"8";"96";"“Yes; he’s in the Land Commission."""
"1101";"8";"97";"“I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor O’Hara! Boose, I suppose?"""
"1102";"8";"98";"“Other things, too,"" said Little Chandler shortly."
"1103";"8";"99";"Ignatius Gallaher laughed."
"1104";"8";"100";"“Tommy,"" he said, “I see you haven’t changed an atom. You’re the very same serious person that used to lecture me on"
"1105";"8";"101";"Sunday mornings when I had a sore head and a fur on my tongue. You’d want to knock about a bit in the world. Have you never"
"1106";"8";"102";"been anywhere even for a trip?"""
"1107";"8";"103";"“I’ve been to the Isle of Man,"" said Little Chandler."
"1108";"8";"104";"Ignatius Gallaher laughed."
"1109";"8";"105";"“The Isle of Man!"" he said. “Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice. That’d do you good."""
"1110";"8";"106";"“Have you seen Paris?"""
"1111";"8";"107";"“I should think I have! I’ve knocked about there a little."""
"1112";"8";"108";"“And is it really so beautiful as they say?"" asked Little Chandler."
"1113";"8";"109";"He sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his boldly."
"1114";"8";"110";"“Beautiful?"" said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink. “It’s not so beautiful, you"
"1115";"8";"111";"know. Of course, it is beautiful.... But it’s the life of Paris; that’s the thing. Ah, there’s no city like Paris for"
"1116";"8";"112";"gaiety, movement, excitement...."""
"1117";"8";"113";"Little Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded in catching the barman’s eye. He ordered the same"
"1118";"8";"114";"again."
"1119";"8";"115";"“I’ve been to the Moulin Rouge,"" Ignatius Gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses, “and I’ve been to"
"1120";"8";"116";"all the Bohemian cafes. Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy."""
"1121";"8";"117";"Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses: then he touched his friend’s glass lightly and"
"1122";"8";"118";"reciprocated the former toast. He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. Gallaher’s accent and way of expressing"
"1123";"8";"119";"himself did not please him. There was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. But perhaps it was"
"1124";"8";"120";"only the result of living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there"
"1125";"8";"121";"under this new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his friend"
"1126";"8";"122";"enviously."
"1127";"8";"123";"“Everything in Paris is gay,"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “They believe in enjoying life - and don’t you think they’re right?"
"1128";"8";"124";"If you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they’ve a great feeling for the Irish there."
"1129";"8";"125";"When they heard I was from Ireland they were ready to eat me, man."""
"1130";"8";"126";"Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass."
"1131";"8";"127";"“Tell me,"" he said, “is it true that Paris is so... immoral as they say?"""
"1132";"8";"128";"Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm."
"1133";"8";"129";"“Every place is immoral,"" he said. “Of course you do find spicy bits in Paris. Go to one of the students’ balls, for"
"1134";"8";"130";"instance. That’s lively, if you like, when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose. You know what they are, I"
"1135";"8";"131";"suppose?"""
"1136";"8";"132";"“I’ve heard of them,"" said Little Chandler."
"1137";"8";"133";"Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his had."
"1138";"8";"134";"“Ah,"" he said, “you may say what you like. There’s no woman like the Parisienne - for style, for go."""
"1139";"8";"135";"“Then it is an immoral city,"" said Little Chandler, with timid insistence -“I mean, compared with London or Dublin?"""
"1140";"8";"136";"“London!"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “It’s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a"
"1141";"8";"137";"bit about London when he was over there. He’d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don’t make punch of that whisky: liquor"
"1142";"8";"138";"up."""
"1143";"8";"139";"“No, really...."""
"1144";"8";"140";"“O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm. What is it? The same again, I suppose?"""
"1145";"8";"141";"“Well... all right."""
"1146";"8";"142";"“Francois, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?"""
"1147";"8";"143";"Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their"
"1148";"8";"144";"drinks were served."
"1149";"8";"145";"“I’ll tell you my opinion,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had"
"1150";"8";"146";"taken refuge, “it’s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I’ve heard of cases - what am I saying?- I’ve known them: cases of..."
"1151";"8";"147";"immorality...."""
"1152";"8";"148";"Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm historian’s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his"
"1153";"8";"149";"friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined"
"1154";"8";"150";"to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had"
"1155";"8";"151";"personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent"
"1156";"8";"152";"and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about"
"1157";"8";"153";"an English duchess - a story which he knew to be true. Little Chandler as astonished."
"1158";"8";"154";"“Ah, well,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, “here we are in old jog-along Dublin where nothing is known of such things."""
"1159";"8";"155";"“How dull you must find it,"" said Little Chandler, “after all the other places you’ve seen!"""
"1160";"8";"156";"Well,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, “it’s a relaxation to come over here, you know. And, after all, it’s the old country, as"
"1161";"8";"157";"they say, isn’t it? You can’t help having a certain feeling for it. That’s human nature.... But tell me something about"
"1162";"8";"158";"yourself. Hogan told me you had... tasted the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn’t it?"""
"1163";"8";"159";"Little Chandler blushed and smiled."
"1164";"8";"160";"“Yes,"" he said. “I was married last May twelve months."""
"1165";"8";"161";"“I hope it’s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “I didn’t know your address or I’d"
"1166";"8";"162";"have done so at the time."""
"1167";"8";"163";"He extended his hand, which Little Chandler took."
"1168";"8";"164";"“Well, Tommy,"" he said, “I wish you and yours every joy in life, old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till"
"1169";"8";"165";"I shoot you. And that’s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?"""
"1170";"8";"166";"“I know that,"" said Little Chandler."
"1171";"8";"167";"“Any youngsters?"" said Ignatius Gallaher."
"1172";"8";"168";"Little Chandler blushed again."
"1173";"8";"169";"“We have one child,"" he said."
"1174";"8";"170";"“Son or daughter?"""
"1175";"8";"171";"“A little boy."""
"1176";"8";"172";"Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back."
"1177";"8";"173";"“Bravo,"" he said, “I wouldn’t doubt you, Tommy."""
"1178";"8";"174";"Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth."
"1179";"8";"175";"“I hope you’ll spend an evening with us,"" he said, “before you go back. My wife will be delighted to meet you. We can"
"1180";"8";"176";"have a little music and --"""
"1181";"8";"177";"“Thanks awfully, old chap,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, “I’m sorry we didn’t meet earlier. But I must leave tomorrow"
"1182";"8";"178";"night."""
"1183";"8";"179";"“Tonight, perhaps...?"""
"1184";"8";"180";"“I’m awfully sorry, old man. You see I’m over here with another fellow, clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to"
"1185";"8";"181";"go to a little card-party. Only for that..."""
"1186";"8";"182";"“O, in that case..."""
"1187";"8";"183";"“But who knows?"" said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. “Next year I may take a little skip over here now that I’ve broken"
"1188";"8";"184";"the ice. It’s only a pleasure deferred."""
"1189";"8";"185";"“Very well,"" said Little Chandler, “the next time you come we must have an evening together. That’s agreed now, isn’t"
"1190";"8";"186";"it?"""
"1191";"8";"187";"“Yes, that’s agreed,"" said Ignatius Gallaher. “Next year if I come, parole d’honneur."""
"1192";"8";"188";"“And to clinch the bargain,"" said Little Chandler, “we’ll just have one more now."""
"1193";"8";"189";"Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked a it."
"1194";"8";"190";"“Is it to be the last?"" he said. “Because you know, I have an a.p."""
"1195";"8";"191";"“O, yes, positively,"" said Little Chandler."
"1196";"8";"192";"“Very well, then,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, “let us have another one as a deoc an doruis - that’s good vernacular for a"
"1197";"8";"193";"small whisky, I believe."""
"1198";"8";"194";"Little Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself. A"
"1199";"8";"195";"trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited. Three small whiskies had gone to his head and"
"1200";"8";"196";"Gallaher’s strong cigar had confused his mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person. The adventure of meeting Gallaher"
"1201";"8";"197";"after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher in Corless’s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher’s"
"1202";"8";"198";"stories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher’s vagrant and triumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive"
"1203";"8";"199";"nature. He felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend’s and it seemed to him unjust. Gallaher was his"
"1204";"8";"200";"inferior in birth and education. He was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever"
"1205";"8";"201";"do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His"
"1206";"8";"202";"unfortunate timidity He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his manhood. He saw behind Gallaher’s refusal of"
"1207";"8";"203";"his invitation. Gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising Ireland by his visit."
"1208";"8";"204";"The barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly."
"1209";"8";"205";"“Who knows?"" he said, as they lifted their glasses. “When you come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life"
"1210";"8";"206";"and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Ignatius Gallaher."""
"1211";"8";"207";"Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he"
"1212";"8";"208";"smacked his lips decisively, set down his glass and said:"
"1213";"8";"209";"“No blooming fear of that, my boy. I’m going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before I put my"
"1214";"8";"210";"head in the sack - if I ever do."""
"1215";"8";"211";"“Some day you will,"" said Little Chandler calmly."
"1216";"8";"212";"Ignatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend."
"1217";"8";"213";"“You think so?"" he said."
"1218";"8";"214";"“You’ll put your head in the sack,"" repeated Little Chandler stoutly, “like everyone else if you can find the girl."""
"1219";"8";"215";"He had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened"
"1220";"8";"216";"in his cheek, he did not flinch from his friend’s gaze. Ignatius Gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said:"
"1221";"8";"217";"“If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there’ll be no mooning and spooning about it. I mean to marry money."
"1222";"8";"218";"She’ll have a good fat account at the bank or she won’t do for me."""
"1223";"8";"219";"Little Chandler shook his head."
"1224";"8";"220";"“Why, man alive,"" said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, “do you know what it is? I’ve only to say the word and tomorrow I"
"1225";"8";"221";"can have the woman and the cash. You don’t believe it? Well, I know it. There are hundreds - what am I saying?- thousands of"
"1226";"8";"222";"rich Germans and Jews, rotten with money, that’d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if I don’t play my cards"
"1227";"8";"223";"properly. When I go about a thing I mean business, I tell you. You just wait."""
"1228";"8";"224";"He tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed loudly. Then he looked thoughtfully before him and said"
"1229";"8";"225";"in a calmer tone:"
"1230";"8";"226";"“But I’m in no hurry. They can wait. I don’t fancy tying myself up to one woman, you know."""
"1231";"8";"227";"He imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face."
"1232";"8";"228";"“Must get a bit stale, I should think,"" he said."
"1233";"8";"229";"Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his arms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie’s"
"1234";"8";"230";"young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help. But Monica had gone home"
"1235";"8";"231";"long ago. It was a quarter to nine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring"
"1236";"8";"232";"Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley’s. Of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she"
"1237";"8";"233";"would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself"
"1238";"8";"234";"for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:"
"1239";"8";"235";"“Here. Don’t waken him."""
"1240";"8";"236";"A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a"
"1241";"8";"237";"frame of crumpled horn. It was Annie’s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips. She wore"
"1242";"8";"238";"the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and elevenpence;"
"1243";"8";"239";"but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was"
"1244";"8";"240";"empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies’ blouses before him, paying at"
"1245";"8";"241";"the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to"
"1246";"8";"242";"hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied. When he brought the blouse home"
"1247";"8";"243";"Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and"
"1248";"8";"244";"said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it. At first she wanted to take it back but when she tried"
"1249";"8";"245";"it on she was delighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed him and said he was very good to think"
"1250";"8";"246";"of her."
"1251";"8";"247";"Hm!..."
"1252";"8";"248";"He looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly. Certainly they were pretty and the face itself"
"1253";"8";"249";"was pretty. But he found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike? The composure of the eyes irritated"
"1254";"8";"250";"him. They repelled him and defied him: there was no passion in them, no rapture. He thought of what Gallaher had said about"
"1255";"8";"251";"rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes, he thought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!... Why had he"
"1256";"8";"252";"married the eyes in the photograph?"
"1257";"8";"253";"He caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room. He found something mean in the pretty"
"1258";"8";"254";"furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and it reminded hi of her. It"
"1259";"8";"255";"too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment against his life awoke within him. Could he not escape from his little house? Was"
"1260";"8";"256";"it too late for him to try to live bravely like Gallaher? Could he go to London? There was the furniture still to be paid"
"1261";"8";"257";"for. If he could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way for him."
"1262";"8";"258";"A volume of Byron’s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken"
"1263";"8";"259";"the child and began to read the first poem in the book:"
"1264";"8";"260";"Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom,"
"1265";"8";"261";"Not e’en a Zephyr wanders through the grove,"
"1266";"8";"262";"Whilst I return to view my Margaret’s tomb"
"1267";"8";"263";"And scatter flowers on tbe dust I love."
"1268";"8";"264";"He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that,"
"1269";"8";"265";"express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours"
"1270";"8";"266";"before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into that mood...."
"1271";"8";"267";"The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to"
"1272";"8";"268";"rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second"
"1273";"8";"269";"stanza:"
"1274";"8";"270";"Within this narrow cell reclines her clay,"
"1275";"8";"271";"That clay where once..."
"1276";"8";"272";"It was useless. He couldn’t read. He couldn’t do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was"
"1277";"8";"273";"useless, useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child’s face he"
"1278";"8";"274";"shouted:"
"1279";"8";"275";"“Stop!"""
"1280";"8";"276";"The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream. He jumped up from his chair and walked"
"1281";"8";"277";"hastily up and down the room with the child in his arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its breath for four or five"
"1282";"8";"278";"seconds, and then bursting out anew. The thin walls of the room echoed the sound. He tried to soothe it but it sobbed more"
"1283";"8";"279";"convulsively. He looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed. He counted seven sobs"
"1284";"8";"280";"without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright. If it died!..."
"1285";"8";"281";"The door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting."
"1286";"8";"282";"“What is it? What is it?"" she cried."
"1287";"8";"283";"The child, hearing its mother’s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing."
"1288";"8";"284";"“It’s nothing, Annie ... it’s nothing.... He began to cry..."""
"1289";"8";"285";"She flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him."
"1290";"8";"286";"“What have you done to him?"" she cried, glaring into his face."
"1291";"8";"287";"Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them."
"1292";"8";"288";"He began to stammer:"
"1293";"8";"289";"“It’s nothing.... He ... he began to cry.... I couldn’t ... I didn’t do anything.... What?"""
"1294";"8";"290";"Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:"
"1295";"8";"291";"“My little man! My little mannie! Was ""˜ou frightened, love?... There now, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma’s little"
"1296";"8";"292";"lamb of the world!... There now!"""
"1297";"8";"293";"Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight. He listened while the"
"1298";"8";"294";"paroxysm of the child’s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes."
"1299";"9";"2";"“Send Farrington here!"""
"1300";"9";"3";"Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk:"
"1301";"9";"4";"“Mr. Alleyne wants you upstairs."""
"1302";"9";"5";"The man muttered “Blast him!"" under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of"
"1303";"9";"6";"great bulk. He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly"
"1304";"9";"7";"and the whites of them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy"
"1305";"9";"8";"step."
"1306";"9";"9";"He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription Mr."
"1307";"9";"10";"Alleyne. Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice cried:"
"1308";"9";"11";"“Come in!"""
"1309";"9";"12";"The man entered Mr. Alleyne’s room. Simultaneously Mr. Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a cleanshaven"
"1310";"9";"13";"face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg"
"1311";"9";"14";"reposing on the papers. Mr. Alleyne did not lose a moment:"
"1312";"9";"15";"“Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven’t made a copy"
"1313";"9";"16";"of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four o’clock."""
"1314";"9";"17";"“But Mr. Shelley said, sir --"""
"1315";"9";"18";"“Mr. Shelley said, sir .... Kindly attend to what I say and not to what Mr. Shelley says, sir. You have always some"
"1316";"9";"19";"excuse or another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening I’ll lay the"
"1317";"9";"20";"matter before Mr. Crosbie.... Do you hear me now?"""
"1318";"9";"21";"“Yes, sir."""
"1319";"9";"22";"“Do you hear me now?... Ay and another little matter! I might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you."
"1320";"9";"23";"Understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want,"
"1321";"9";"24";"I’d like to know.... Do you mind me now?"""
"1322";"9";"25";"“Yes, sir."""
"1323";"9";"26";"Mr. Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the"
"1324";"9";"27";"affairs of Crosbie &amp; Alleyne, gauging its fragility. A spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then"
"1325";"9";"28";"passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst. The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good"
"1326";"9";"29";"night’s drinking. The middle of the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time, Mr. Alleyne might give him"
"1327";"9";"30";"an order on the cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers. Suddenly Mr. Alleyne began to"
"1328";"9";"31";"upset all the papers, searching for something. Then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till that moment, he"
"1329";"9";"32";"shot up his head again, saying:"
"1330";"9";"33";"“Eh? Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington, you take things easy!"""
"1331";"9";"34";"“I was waiting to see..."""
"1332";"9";"35";"“Very good, you needn’t wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work."""
"1333";"9";"36";"The man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room, he heard Mr. Alleyne cry after him that if the"
"1334";"9";"37";"contract was not copied by evening Mr. Crosbie would hear of the matter."
"1335";"9";"38";"He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied. He took up his pen and"
"1336";"9";"39";"dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written: In no case shall the said Bernard"
"1337";"9";"40";"Bodley be... The evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He felt that"
"1338";"9";"41";"he must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his desk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the"
"1339";"9";"42";"office. As he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly."
"1340";"9";"43";"“It’s all right, Mr. Shelley,"" said the man, pointing with his finger to indicate the objective of his journey."
"1341";"9";"44";"The chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack, but, seeing the row complete, offered no remark. As soon as he was on the"
"1342";"9";"45";"landing the man pulled a shepherd’s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs."
"1343";"9";"46";"From the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a"
"1344";"9";"47";"doorway. He was now safe in the dark snug of O’Neill’s shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with"
"1345";"9";"48";"his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:"
"1346";"9";"49";"“Here, Pat, give us a g.p.. like a good fellow."""
"1347";"9";"50";"The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny"
"1348";"9";"51";"on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had"
"1349";"9";"52";"entered it."
"1350";"9";"53";"Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit."
"1351";"9";"54";"The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time."
"1352";"9";"55";"On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he was out in"
"1353";"9";"56";"O’Neill’s. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absentmindedness."
"1354";"9";"57";"“Mr. Alleyne has been calling for you,"" said the chief clerk severely. “Where were you?"""
"1355";"9";"58";"The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him"
"1356";"9";"59";"from answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh."
"1357";"9";"60";"“I know that game,"" he said. “Five times in one day is a little bit... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our"
"1358";"9";"61";"correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr. Alleyne."""
"1359";"9";"62";"This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the"
"1360";"9";"63";"man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of"
"1361";"9";"64";"the contract before half past five. The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his"
"1362";"9";"65";"friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the"
"1363";"9";"66";"office. He hoped Mr. Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing."
"1364";"9";"67";"The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr. Alleyne’s room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish"
"1365";"9";"68";"appearance. Mr. Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long time"
"1366";"9";"69";"when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding"
"1367";"9";"70";"the great black feather in her hat. Mr. Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily"
"1368";"9";"71";"upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr. Alleyne nor Miss"
"1369";"9";"72";"Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr. Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if"
"1370";"9";"73";"to say: “That’s all right: you can go."""
"1371";"9";"74";"The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no"
"1372";"9";"75";"case shall the said Bernard Bodley be... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same"
"1373";"9";"76";"letter. The chief clerk began to hurry Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post. The man"
"1374";"9";"77";"listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not"
"1375";"9";"78";"clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It was a night for hot punches. He struggled"
"1376";"9";"79";"on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it! He couldn’t finish it in"
"1377";"9";"80";"time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote Bernard"
"1378";"9";"81";"Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet."
"1379";"9";"82";"He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel"
"1380";"9";"83";"in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the"
"1381";"9";"84";"cashier was no good, no damn good: he wouldn’t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys: Leonard and"
"1382";"9";"85";"O’Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot."
"1383";"9";"86";"His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered. Mr. Alleyne and Miss Delacour"
"1384";"9";"87";"were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of something. The man got up from his"
"1385";"9";"88";"desk. Mr. Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he knew nothing about"
"1386";"9";"89";"them, that he had made a faithful copy. The tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly"
"1387";"9";"90";"restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him:"
"1388";"9";"91";"“I know nothing about any other two letters,"" he said stupidly."
"1389";"9";"92";"“You - know - nothing. Of course you know nothing,"" said Mr. Alleyne. “Tell me,"" he added, glancing first for approval to"
"1390";"9";"93";"the lady beside him, “do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?"""
"1391";"9";"94";"The man glanced from the lady’s face to the little egg-shaped head and back again; and, almost before he was aware of it,"
"1392";"9";"95";"his tongue had found a felicitous moment:"
"1393";"9";"96";"“I don’t think, sir,"" he said, “that that’s a fair question to put to me."""
"1394";"9";"97";"There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Everyone was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than"
"1395";"9";"98";"his neighbours) and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly. Mr. Alleyne flushed to the hue of"
"1396";"9";"99";"a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf s passion. He shook his fist in the man’s face till it seemed to vibrate"
"1397";"9";"100";"like the knob of some electric machine:"
"1398";"9";"101";"“You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I’ll make short work of you! Wait till you see! You’ll apologise to me"
"1399";"9";"102";"for your impertinence or you’ll quit the office instanter! You’ll quit this, I’m telling you, or you’ll apologise to"
"1400";"9";"103";"me!"""
"1401";"9";"104";"He stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed out"
"1402";"9";"105";"and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief"
"1403";"9";"106";"clerk. The man felt that his position was bad enough. He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr. Alleyne for his"
"1404";"9";"107";"impertinence but he knew what a hornet’s nest the office would be for him. He could remember the way in which Mr. Alleyne"
"1405";"9";"108";"had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew. He felt savage and thirsty and"
"1406";"9";"109";"revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else. Mr. Alleyne would never give him an hour’s rest; his life would be"
"1407";"9";"110";"a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time. Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never"
"1408";"9";"111";"pulled together from the first, he and Mr. Alleyne, ever since the day Mr. Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of"
"1409";"9";"112";"Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the"
"1410";"9";"113";"money, but sure Higgins never had anything for himself. A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he"
"1411";"9";"114";"couldn’t...."
"1412";"9";"115";"He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered"
"1413";"9";"116";"could he touch Pat in O’Neill’s. He could not touch him for more than a bob - and a bob was no use. Yet he must get money"
"1414";"9";"117";"somewhere or other: he had spent his last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere."
"1415";"9";"118";"Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain, he thought of Terry Kelly’s pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the dart!"
"1416";"9";"119";"Why didn’t he think of it sooner?"
"1417";"9";"120";"He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he"
"1418";"9";"121";"was going to have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly’s said A crown! but the consignor held out for six shillings;"
"1419";"9";"122";"and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little"
"1420";"9";"123";"cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and"
"1421";"9";"124";"women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions. The man"
"1422";"9";"125";"passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the"
"1423";"9";"126";"office-girls. His head was full of the noises of tram - gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling"
"1424";"9";"127";"fumes punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys:"
"1425";"9";"128";"“So, I just looked at him - coolly, you know, and looked at her. Then I looked back at him again - taking my time, you"
"1426";"9";"129";"know. ""˜I don’t think that that’s a fair question to put to me,’ says I."""
"1427";"9";"130";"Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne’s and, when he heard the story, he stood Farrington a"
"1428";"9";"131";"half-one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O’Halloran"
"1429";"9";"132";"and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O’Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the"
"1430";"9";"133";"story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan’s of Fownes’s Street; but, as the retort was after"
"1431";"9";"134";"the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington’s retort. At"
"1432";"9";"135";"this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another."
"1433";"9";"136";"Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The"
"1434";"9";"137";"men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very"
"1435";"9";"138";"exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr. Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington’s face. Then"
"1436";"9";"139";"he imitated Farrington, saying, “And here was my nabs, as cool as you please,"" while Farrington looked at the company out of"
"1437";"9";"140";"his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower"
"1438";"9";"141";"lip."
"1439";"9";"142";"When that round was over there was a pause. O’Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the"
"1440";"9";"143";"whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the"
"1441";"9";"144";"left while the other three turned back towards the city. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached"
"1442";"9";"145";"the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and"
"1443";"9";"146";"glasses. The three men pushed past the whining matchsellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the"
"1444";"9";"147";"counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the"
"1445";"9";"148";"Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish"
"1446";"9";"149";"and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too;"
"1447";"9";"150";"but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O’Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood"
"1448";"9";"151";"another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and"
"1449";"9";"152";"introduce them to some nice girls. O’Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn’t go because he"
"1450";"9";"153";"was a married man; and Farrington’s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed."
"1451";"9";"154";"Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan’s in"
"1452";"9";"155";"Poolbeg Street."
"1453";"9";"156";"When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan’s. They went into the parlour at the back and O’Halloran ordered"
"1454";"9";"157";"small hot specials all round. They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when"
"1455";"9";"158";"Weathers came back. Much to Farrington’s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but they had"
"1456";"9";"159";"enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a"
"1457";"9";"160";"table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington’s eyes wandered at"
"1458";"9";"161";"every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of"
"1459";"9";"162";"peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves,"
"1460";"9";"163";"reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and"
"1461";"9";"164";"when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring"
"1462";"9";"165";"expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed"
"1463";"9";"166";"against his chair and said “O, pardon!"" in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look"
"1464";"9";"167";"back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all"
"1465";"9";"168";"the whiskies and Apolinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge. He was so"
"1466";"9";"169";"angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends."
"1467";"9";"170";"When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps"
"1468";"9";"171";"muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour."
"1469";"9";"172";"Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and"
"1470";"9";"173";"compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on"
"1471";"9";"174";"it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said “Go!"" each was to try to bring down the other’s hand on to the table. Farrington"
"1472";"9";"175";"looked very serious and determined."
"1473";"9";"176";"The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent’s hand slowly down on to the table."
"1474";"9";"177";"Farrington’s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a"
"1475";"9";"178";"stripling."
"1476";"9";"179";"“You’re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,"" he said."
"1477";"9";"180";"“Who’s not playing fair?"" said the other."
"1478";"9";"181";"“Come on again. The two best out of three."""
"1479";"9";"182";"The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington’s forehead, and the pallor of Weathers’ complexion changed to"
"1480";"9";"183";"peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent’s hand"
"1481";"9";"184";"slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table,"
"1482";"9";"185";"nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:"
"1483";"9";"186";"“Ah! that’s the knack!"""
"1484";"9";"187";"“What the hell do you know about it?"" said Farrington fiercely, turning on the man. “What do you put in your gab"
"1485";"9";"188";"for?"""
"1486";"9";"189";"“Sh, sh!"" said O’Halloran, observing the violent expression of Farrington’s face. “Pony up, boys. We’ll have just one"
"1487";"9";"190";"little smahan more and then we’ll be off."""
"1488";"9";"191";"A very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O’Connell Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home."
"1489";"9";"192";"He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he"
"1490";"9";"193";"had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all"
"1491";"9";"194";"his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking"
"1492";"9";"195";"public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with"
"1493";"9";"196";"fury and, when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said Pardon! his fury nearly choked"
"1494";"9";"197";"him."
"1495";"9";"198";"His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks."
"1496";"9";"199";"He loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the side - door he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly"
"1497";"9";"200";"out. He bawled upstairs:"
"1498";"9";"201";"“Ada! Ada!"""
"1499";"9";"202";"His wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was"
"1500";"9";"203";"drunk. They had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs."
"1501";"9";"204";"“Who is that?"" said the man, peering through the darkness."
"1502";"9";"205";"“Me, pa."""
"1503";"9";"206";"“Who are you? Charlie?"""
"1504";"9";"207";"“No, pa. Tom."""
"1505";"9";"208";"“Where’s your mother?"""
"1506";"9";"209";"“She’s out at the chapel."""
"1507";"9";"210";"“That’s right.... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?"""
"1508";"9";"211";"“Yes, pa. I-"""
"1509";"9";"212";"“Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness? Are the other children in bed?"""
"1510";"9";"213";"The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit the lamp. He began to mimic his son’s flat accent,"
"1511";"9";"214";"saying half to himself: “At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!"" When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table"
"1512";"9";"215";"and shouted:"
"1513";"9";"216";"“What’s for my dinner?"""
"1514";"9";"217";"“I’m going... to cook it, pa,"" said the little boy."
"1515";"9";"218";"The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire."
"1516";"9";"219";"“On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I’ll teach you to do that again!"""
"1517";"9";"220";"He took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was standing behind it."
"1518";"9";"221";"“I’ll teach you to let the fire out!"" he said, rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play."
"1519";"9";"222";"The little boy cried “O, pa!"" and ran whimpering round the table, but the man followed him and caught him by the coat."
"1520";"9";"223";"The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees."
"1521";"9";"224";"“Now, you’ll let the fire out the next time!"" said the man striking at him vigorously with the stick. “Take that, you"
"1522";"9";"225";"little whelp!"""
"1523";"9";"226";"The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook"
"1524";"9";"227";"with fright."
"1525";"9";"228";"“O, pa!"" he cried. “Don’t beat me, pa! And I’ll... I’ll say a Hail Mary for you.... I’ll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if"
"1526";"9";"229";"you don’t beat me.... I’ll say a Hail Mary...."""
"1527";"10";"2";"Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin. She talked a little through"
"1528";"10";"3";"her nose, always soothingly: “Yes, my dear,"" and “No, my dear."" She was always sent for when the women quarrelled Over their"
"1529";"10";"4";"tubs and always succeeded in making peace. One day the matron had said to her:"
"1530";"10";"5";"“Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!"""
"1531";"10";"6";"And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment. And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she"
"1532";"10";"7";"wouldn’t do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn’t for Maria. Everyone was so fond of Maria."
"1533";"10";"8";"The women would have their tea at six o’clock and she would be able to get away before seven. From Ballsbridge to the"
"1534";"10";"9";"Pillar, twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things. She would be"
"1535";"10";"10";"there before eight. She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words A Present from Belfast. She was"
"1536";"10";"11";"very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a"
"1537";"10";"12";"Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five shillings clear after paying tram"
"1538";"10";"13";"fare. What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn’t come in drunk. He was"
"1539";"10";"14";"so different when he took any drink."
"1540";"10";"15";"Often he had wanted her to go and live with them;-but she would have felt herself in the way (though Joe’s wife was ever"
"1541";"10";"16";"so nice with her) and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a good fellow. She had nursed him and"
"1542";"10";"17";"Alphy too; and Joe used often say:"
"1543";"10";"18";"“Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother."""
"1544";"10";"19";"After the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the Dublin by Lamplight laundry, and she liked it. She"
"1545";"10";"20";"used to have such a bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice people, a little quiet and serious,"
"1546";"10";"21";"but still very nice people to live with. Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them. She"
"1547";"10";"22";"had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from"
"1548";"10";"23";"her conservatory. There was one thing she didn’t like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice"
"1549";"10";"24";"person to deal with, so genteel."
"1550";"10";"25";"When the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women’s room and began to pull the big bell. In a few"
"1551";"10";"26";"minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the"
"1552";"10";"27";"sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy"
"1553";"10";"28";"filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the"
"1554";"10";"29";"barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal."
"1555";"10";"30";"Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to"
"1556";"10";"31";"laugh and say she didn’t want any ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed"
"1557";"10";"32";"shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. Then Ginger Mooney lifted her mug of tea and proposed"
"1558";"10";"33";"Maria’s health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she was sorry she hadn’t a sup of"
"1559";"10";"34";"porter to drink it in. And Maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her minute"
"1560";"10";"35";"body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney meant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common"
"1561";"10";"36";"woman."
"1562";"10";"37";"But wasn’t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the"
"1563";"10";"38";"tea-things! She went into her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the hand of"
"1564";"10";"39";"the alarm from seven to six. Then she took off her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed"
"1565";"10";"40";"and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She changed her blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she"
"1566";"10";"41";"thought of how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl; and she looked with quaint affection"
"1567";"10";"42";"at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned, In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little body."
"1568";"10";"43";"When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof. The tram was full"
"1569";"10";"44";"and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes barely touching the"
"1570";"10";"45";"floor. She arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have"
"1571";"10";"46";"your own money in your pocket. She hoped they would have a nice evening. She was sure they would but she could not help"
"1572";"10";"47";"thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking. They were always falling out now but when they were boys"
"1573";"10";"48";"together they used to be the best of friends: but such was life."
"1574";"10";"49";"She got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowds. She went into Downes’s cake-shop but"
"1575";"10";"50";"the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to. She bought a dozen of mixed"
"1576";"10";"51";"penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to"
"1577";"10";"52";"buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she"
"1578";"10";"53";"could think of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes’s plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so"
"1579";"10";"54";"she went over to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the"
"1580";"10";"55";"counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That made Maria blush"
"1581";"10";"56";"and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake,"
"1582";"10";"57";"parcelled it up and said:"
"1583";"10";"58";"“Two-and-four, please."""
"1584";"10";"59";"She thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an"
"1585";"10";"60";"elderly gentleman made room for her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had a square red face and a"
"1586";"10";"61";"greyish moustache. Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the"
"1587";"10";"62";"young men who simply stared straight before them. The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy"
"1588";"10";"63";"weather. He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters"
"1589";"10";"64";"should enjoy themselves while they were young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems. He was very"
"1590";"10";"65";"nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised"
"1591";"10";"66";"his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she"
"1592";"10";"67";"thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken."
"1593";"10";"68";"Everybody said: “0, here’s Maria!"" when she came to Joe’s house. Joe was there, having come home from business, and all"
"1594";"10";"69";"the children had their Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next door and games were going on. Maria gave the"
"1595";"10";"70";"bag of cakes to the eldest boy, Alphy, to divide and Mrs. Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a big bag of"
"1596";"10";"71";"cakes and made all the children say:"
"1597";"10";"72";"“Thanks, Maria."""
"1598";"10";"73";"But Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma, something they would be sure to like, and she began"
"1599";"10";"74";"to look for her plumcake. She tried in Downes’s bag and then in the pockets of her waterproof and then on the hallstand but"
"1600";"10";"75";"nowhere could she find it. Then she asked all the children had any of them eaten it - by mistake, of course - but the"
"1601";"10";"76";"children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a"
"1602";"10";"77";"solution for the mystery and Mrs. Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram. Maria,"
"1603";"10";"78";"remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame and vexation and"
"1604";"10";"79";"disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for"
"1605";"10";"80";"nothing she nearly cried outright."
"1606";"10";"81";"But Joe said it didn’t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was very nice with her. He told her all that went on"
"1607";"10";"82";"in his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not understand why Joe laughed"
"1608";"10";"83";"so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe"
"1609";"10";"84";"said he wasn’t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn’t rub him the wrong way."
"1610";"10";"85";"Mrs. Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed round the"
"1611";"10";"86";"nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to"
"1612";"10";"87";"crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said she didn’t like nuts and that they weren’t to bother about her. Then Joe"
"1613";"10";"88";"asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs. Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that."
"1614";"10";"89";"Maria said she would rather they didn’t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted."
"1615";"10";"90";"So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good"
"1616";"10";"91";"word for Alphy. But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria"
"1617";"10";"92";"said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs. Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that"
"1618";"10";"93";"way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of"
"1619";"10";"94";"it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The"
"1620";"10";"95";"two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again. Maria was delighted to see the"
"1621";"10";"96";"children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led"
"1622";"10";"97";"the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the"
"1623";"10";"98";"next-door girls got the ring Mrs. Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: 0, I know all about it!"
"1624";"10";"99";"They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were"
"1625";"10";"100";"putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin."
"1626";"10";"101";"They led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do. She"
"1627";"10";"102";"moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her"
"1628";"10";"103";"fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great"
"1629";"10";"104";"deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs. Donnelly said something very"
"1630";"10";"105";"cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was"
"1631";"10";"106";"wrong that time and so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book."
"1632";"10";"107";"After that Mrs. Donnelly played Miss McCloud’s Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they"
"1633";"10";"108";"were all quite merry again and Mrs. Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got"
"1634";"10";"109";"the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences."
"1635";"10";"110";"She said they were all very good to her."
"1636";"10";"111";"At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one"
"1637";"10";"112";"of the old songs. Mrs. Donnelly said “Do, please, Maria!"" and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs."
"1638";"10";"113";"Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria’s song. Then she played the prelude and said “Now, Maria!"" and"
"1639";"10";"114";"Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice. She sang I Dreamt that I Dwelt, and when she came to the"
"1640";"10";"115";"second verse she sang again:"
"1641";"10";"116";"I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls"
"1642";"10";"117";"With vassals and serfs at my side,"
"1643";"10";"118";"And of all who assembled within those walls"
"1644";"10";"119";"That I was the hope and the pride."
"1645";"10";"120";"I had riches too great to count; could boast"
"1646";"10";"121";"Of a high ancestral name,"
"1647";"10";"122";"But I also dreamt, which pleased me most,"
"1648";"10";"123";"That you loved me still the same."
"1649";"10";"124";"But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved. He said that there was"
"1650";"10";"125";"no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up"
"1651";"10";"126";"so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where"
"1652";"10";"127";"the corkscrew was."
"1653";"11";"2";"Mr. Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder. A medival doctor would have called him"
"1654";"11";"3";"saturnine. His face, which carried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin streets. On his long and"
"1655";"11";"4";"rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth. His cheekbones also gave"
"1656";"11";"5";"his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the eyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny"
"1657";"11";"6";"eyebrows, gave the impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in others but often disappointed. He lived"
"1658";"11";"7";"at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glasses. He had an odd autobiographical habit"
"1659";"11";"8";"which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third"
"1660";"11";"9";"person and a predicate in the past tense. He never gave alms to beggars and walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel."
"1661";"11";"10";"He had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street. Every morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram."
"1662";"11";"11";"At midday he went to Dan Burke’s and took his lunch - a bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits. At"
"1663";"11";"12";"four o’clock he was set free. He dined in an eating-house in George’s Street where he felt himself safe from the society o"
"1664";"11";"13";"Dublin’s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare. His evenings were spent either before"
"1665";"11";"14";"his landlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city. His liking for Mozart’s music brought him sometimes to an"
"1666";"11";"15";"opera or a concert: these were the only dissipations of his life."
"1667";"11";"16";"He had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. He lived his spiritual life without any communion with others,"
"1668";"11";"17";"visiting his relatives at Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died. He performed these two social duties"
"1669";"11";"18";"for old dignity’s sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life. He allowed himself to"
"1670";"11";"19";"think that in certain circumstances he would rob his hank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life rolled out"
"1671";"11";"20";"evenly - an adventureless tale."
"1672";"11";"21";"One evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda. The house, thinly peopled and silent, gave"
"1673";"11";"22";"distressing prophecy of failure. The lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house once or twice and then"
"1674";"11";"23";"said:"
"1675";"11";"24";"“What a pity there is such a poor house tonight! It’s so hard on people to have to sing to empty benches."""
"1676";"11";"25";"He took the remark as an invitation to talk. He was surprised that she seemed so little awkward. While they talked he"
"1677";"11";"26";"tried to fix her permanently in his memory. When he learned that the young girl beside her was her daughter he judged her to"
"1678";"11";"27";"be a year or so younger than himself. Her face, which must have been handsome, had remained intelligent. It was an oval face"
"1679";"11";"28";"with strongly marked features. The eyes were very dark blue and steady. Their gaze began with a defiant note but was"
"1680";"11";"29";"confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the iris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great"
"1681";"11";"30";"sensibility. The pupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence, and her"
"1682";"11";"31";"astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom of a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely."
"1683";"11";"32";"He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter’s"
"1684";"11";"33";"attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the"
"1685";"11";"34";"allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs. Sinico. Her husband’s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was"
"1686";"11";"35";"captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child."
"1687";"11";"36";"Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. She came. This was the first of many"
"1688";"11";"37";"meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. Mr. Duffy, however, had"
"1689";"11";"38";"a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her"
"1690";"11";"39";"house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter’s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so"
"1691";"11";"40";"sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. As the"
"1692";"11";"41";"husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr. Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady’s"
"1693";"11";"42";"society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little"
"1694";"11";"43";"he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her. She"
"1695";"11";"44";"listened to all."
"1696";"11";"45";"Sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life. With almost maternal solicitude she urged"
"1697";"11";"46";"him to let his nature open to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some time he had assisted at the"
"1698";"11";"47";"meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret"
"1699";"11";"48";"lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own leader and in its own"
"1700";"11";"49";"garret, he had discontinued his attendances. The workmen’s discussions, he said, were too timorous; the interest they took"
"1701";"11";"50";"in the question of wages was inordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an exactitude"
"1702";"11";"51";"which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to strike"
"1703";"11";"52";"Dublin for some centuries."
"1704";"11";"53";"She asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked her, with careful scorn. To compete with"
"1705";"11";"54";"phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse"
"1706";"11";"55";"middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios?"
"1707";"11";"56";"He went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent their evenings alone. Little by little, as their"
"1708";"11";"57";"thoughts entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic. Many times"
"1709";"11";"58";"she allowed the dark to fall upon them, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark discreet room, their isolation, the"
"1710";"11";"59";"music that still vibrated in their ears united them. This union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character,"
"1711";"11";"60";"emotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought that in her"
"1712";"11";"61";"eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely"
"1713";"11";"62";"to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable loneliness."
"1714";"11";"63";"We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown"
"1715";"11";"64";"every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs. Sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek."
"1716";"11";"65";"Mr. Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week,"
"1717";"11";"66";"then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of"
"1718";"11";"67";"their ruined confessional they meet in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the"
"1719";"11";"68";"cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse:"
"1720";"11";"69";"every bond, he said, is a bond to sorrow. When they came out of the Park they walked in silence towards the tram; but here"
"1721";"11";"70";"she began to tremble so violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her good-bye quickly and left her. A"
"1722";"11";"71";"few days later he received a parcel containing his books and music."
"1723";"11";"72";"Four years passed. Mr. Duffy returned to his even way of life. His room still bore witness of the orderliness of his"
"1724";"11";"73";"mind. Some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by"
"1725";"11";"74";"Nietzsche: Thus Spake Zarathustra and The Gay Science. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk. One of"
"1726";"11";"75";"his sentences, written two months after his last interview with Mrs. Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible"
"1727";"11";"76";"because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual"
"1728";"11";"77";"intercourse. He kept away from concerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior partner of the bank retired."
"1729";"11";"78";"And still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined"
"1730";"11";"79";"moderately in George’s Street and read the evening paper for dessert."
"1731";"11";"80";"One evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed"
"1732";"11";"81";"themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the water-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food"
"1733";"11";"82";"on his plate and read the paragraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate to one side, doubled the"
"1734";"11";"83";"paper down before him between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again. The cabbage began to deposit a cold"
"1735";"11";"84";"white grease on his plate. The girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and"
"1736";"11";"85";"ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out."
"1737";"11";"86";"He walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of"
"1738";"11";"87";"the buff Mail peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to"
"1739";"11";"88";"Chapelizod he slackened his pace. His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost"
"1740";"11";"89";"with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air. When he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking"
"1741";"11";"90";"the paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his"
"1742";"11";"91";"lips as a priest does when he reads the prayers Secreto. This was the paragraph:"
"1743";"11";"92";"DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE"
"1744";"11";"93";"A Painful Case"
"1745";"11";"94";"Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence of Mr. Leverett) held an inquest on the body of"
"1746";"11";"95";"Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening. The evidence showed"
"1747";"11";"96";"that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o’clock slow train"
"1748";"11";"97";"from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death."
"1749";"11";"98";"James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years."
"1750";"11";"99";"On hearing the guard’s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to"
"1751";"11";"100";"loud cries. The train was going slowly."
"1752";"11";"101";"P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines."
"1753";"11";"102";"He ran towards her and shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the"
"1754";"11";"103";"ground."
"1755";"11";"104";"A juror. “You saw the lady fall?"""
"1756";"11";"105";"Witness. “Yes."""
"1757";"11";"106";"Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead. He had"
"1758";"11";"107";"the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance."
"1759";"11";"108";"Constable 57 corroborated."
"1760";"11";"109";"Dr. Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured"
"1761";"11";"110";"and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head had been injured in the fall. The"
"1762";"11";"111";"injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been probably due to shock"
"1763";"11";"112";"and sudden failure of the heart’s action."
"1764";"11";"113";"Mr. H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his deep regret at the accident. The company had"
"1765";"11";"114";"always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges, both by placing notices in every"
"1766";"11";"115";"station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings. The deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines"
"1767";"11";"116";"late at night from platform to platform and, in view of certain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the"
"1768";"11";"117";"railway officials were to blame."
"1769";"11";"118";"Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was"
"1770";"11";"119";"his wife. He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam. They had been"
"1771";"11";"120";"married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in"
"1772";"11";"121";"her habits."
"1773";"11";"122";"Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness,"
"1774";"11";"123";"had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a League. She was not at home until an hour after the"
"1775";"11";"124";"accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame."
"1776";"11";"125";"The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He"
"1777";"11";"126";"urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame"
"1778";"11";"127";"attached to anyone."
"1779";"11";"128";"Mr. Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. The river lay"
"1780";"11";"129";"quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road. What an end! The"
"1781";"11";"130";"whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held"
"1782";"11";"131";"sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the"
"1783";"11";"132";"details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she degraded herself; she had degraded him. He"
"1784";"11";"133";"saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and malodorous. His soul’s companion! He thought of the hobbling wretches whom"
"1785";"11";"134";"he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been unfit to"
"1786";"11";"135";"live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But"
"1787";"11";"136";"that she could have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of"
"1788";"11";"137";"that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no difficulty now in approving of the course"
"1789";"11";"138";"he had taken."
"1790";"11";"139";"As the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his. The shock which had first attacked"
"1791";"11";"140";"his stomach was now attacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out. The cold air met him on the"
"1792";"11";"141";"threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went in and"
"1793";"11";"142";"ordered a hot punch."
"1794";"11";"143";"The proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk. There were five or six workingmen in the shop"
"1795";"11";"144";"discussing the value of a gentleman’s estate in County Kildare They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and"
"1796";"11";"145";"smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr. Duffy"
"1797";"11";"146";"sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them. After a while they went out and he called for another"
"1798";"11";"147";"punch. He sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the Herald and"
"1799";"11";"148";"yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside."
"1800";"11";"149";"As he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he"
"1801";"11";"150";"realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He began to feel ill at ease. He"
"1802";"11";"151";"asked himself what else could he have done. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he could not have"
"1803";"11";"152";"lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him best. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how"
"1804";"11";"153";"lonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that room. His life would be lonely too until he, too,"
"1805";"11";"154";"died, ceased to exist, became a memory - if anyone remembered him."
"1806";"11";"155";"It was after nine o’clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and gloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and"
"1807";"11";"156";"walked along under the gaunt trees. He walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four years before. She seemed"
"1808";"11";"157";"to be near him in the darkness. At moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his. He stood still to"
"1809";"11";"158";"listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to"
"1810";"11";"159";"pieces."
"1811";"11";"160";"When he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked along the river towards Dublin, the lights of which"
"1812";"11";"161";"burned redly and hospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope and, at the base, in the shadow of the wall of the"
"1813";"11";"162";"Park, he saw some human figures lying. Those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed the rectitude of his"
"1814";"11";"163";"life; he felt that he had been outcast from life’s feast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life"
"1815";"11";"164";"and happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame. He knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall"
"1816";"11";"165";"were watching him and wished him gone. No one wanted him; he was outcast from life’s feast. He turned his eyes to the grey"
"1817";"11";"166";"gleaming river, winding along towards Dublin. Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge Station, like"
"1818";"11";"167";"a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness, obstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of sight; but still"
"1819";"11";"168";"he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her name."
"1820";"11";"169";"He turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding in his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what"
"1821";"11";"170";"memory told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not feel her near him in the darkness"
"1822";"11";"171";"nor her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He"
"1823";"11";"172";"listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone."
"1824";"12";"2";"“That’s better now, Mr. O’Connor."""
"1825";"12";"3";"Mr. O’Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the"
"1826";"12";"4";"tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively. Then he began to"
"1827";"12";"5";"roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moment’s thought decided to lick the paper."
"1828";"12";"6";"“Did Mr. Tierney say when he’d be back?"" he asked in a sky falsetto."
"1829";"12";"7";"“He didn’t say."""
"1830";"12";"8";"Mr. O’Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began search his pockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard"
"1831";"12";"9";"cards."
"1832";"12";"10";"“I’ll get you a match,"" said the old man."
"1833";"12";"11";"“Never mind, this’ll do,"" said Mr. O’Connor."
"1834";"12";"12";"He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:"
"1835";"12";"13";"MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS"
"1836";"12";"14";"ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD"
"1837";"12";"15";"Mr. Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the"
"1838";"12";"16";"favour of your vote and influence at the coming election"
"1839";"12";"17";"in the Royal Exchange Ward."
"1840";"12";"18";"Mr. O’Connor had been engaged by Tierney’s agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and"
"1841";"12";"19";"his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with"
"1842";"12";"20";"Jack, the old caretaker. They had been sitting thus since e short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal"
"1843";"12";"21";"and cold out of doors."
"1844";"12";"22";"Mr. O’Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark"

"2049";"12";"227";"“O, don’t let that trouble you, Jack,"" said Mr. Henchy. “Many’s the good man before now drank out of the bottle."""
"2050";"12";"228";"“Anyway, it’s better than nothing,"" said Mr. O’Connor."
"2051";"12";"229";"“He’s not a bad sort,"" said Mr. Henchy, “only Fanning has such a loan of him. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot"

"2055";"12";"233";"“Would you like a drink, boy?"""
"2056";"12";"234";"“If you please, sir,"" said the boy."
"2057";"12";"235";"The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy."
"2058";"12";"236";"“What age are you?"" he asked."
"2059";"12";"237";"“Seventeen,"" said the boy."
"2060";"12";"238";"As the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle. said: “Here’s my best respects, sir, to Mr. Henchy,"" drank"
"2061";"12";"239";"the contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Then he took up the corkscrew and went"
"2062";"12";"240";"out of the door sideways, muttering some form of salutation."
"2063";"12";"241";"“That’s the way it begins,"" said the old man."
"2064";"12";"242";"“The thin edge of the wedge,"" said Mr. Henchy."
"2065";"12";"243";"The old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously. After having"
"2066";"12";"244";"drank each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand’s reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction."
"2067";"12";"245";"“Well, I did a good day’s work today,"" said Mr. Henchy, after a pause."
"2068";"12";"246";"“That so, John?"""
"2069";"12";"247";"“Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he’s a"
"2070";"12";"248";"decent chap, of course), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn’t a word to throw to a dog. He stands and looks"
"2071";"12";"249";"at the people while I do the talking."""
"2072";"12";"250";"Here two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling"
"2073";"12";"251";"from his sloping figure. He had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled"
"2074";"12";"252";"moustache. The other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He wore a very high double collar"
"2075";"12";"253";"and a wide-brimmed bowler hat."
"2076";"12";"254";"“Hello, Crofton!"" said Mr. Henchy to the fat man. “Talk of the devil..."""
"2077";"12";"255";"“Where did the boose come from?"" asked the young man. “Did the cow calve?"""
"2078";"12";"256";"“O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!"" said Mr. O’Connor, laughing."
"2079";"12";"257";"“Is that the way you chaps canvass,"" said Mr. Lyons, “and Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?"""
"2080";"12";"258";"“Why, blast your soul,"" said Mr. Henchy, “I’d get more votes in five minutes than you two’d get in a week."""

"2084";"12";"262";"He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put them on the hob. Then he sat dow-n again by the"
"2085";"12";"263";"fire and took another drink from his bottle. Mr. Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his hat towards the nape of his"
"2086";"12";"264";"neck and began to swing his legs."
"2087";"12";"265";"“Which is my bottle?"" he asked."

"2089";"12";"267";"Mr. Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first"
"2090";"12";"268";"reason, sufficient in itself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that he considered his companions"
"2091";"12";"269";"beneath him. He had been a canvasser for Wilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn their man and,"
"2092";"12";"270";"choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to the Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr."
"2093";"12";"271";"Tiemey."
"2094";"12";"272";"In a few minutes an apologetic “Pok!"" was heard as the cork flew out of Mr. Lyons’ bottle. Mr. Lyons jumped off the"
"2095";"12";"273";"table, went to the fire, took his bottle and carried it back to the table."
"2096";"12";"274";"“I was just telling them, Crofton,"" said Mr. Henchy, that we got a good few votes today."""
"2097";"12";"275";"“Who did you get?"" asked Mr. Lyons."
"2098";"12";"276";"“Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too -"

"2105";"12";"283";"“Listen to me,"" said Mr. Henchy. “What we want in thus country, as I said to old Ward, is capital. The King’s coming here"
"2106";"12";"284";"will mean an influx of money into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it. Look at all the factories down by"
"2107";"12";"285";"the quays there, idle! Look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the mills, the"
"2108";"12";"286";"ship-building yards and factories. It’s capital we want."""
"2109";"12";"287";"“But look here, John,"" said Mr. O’Connor. “Why should we welcome the King of England? Didn’t Parnell himself..."""
"2110";"12";"288";"“Parnell,"" said Mr. Henchy, “is dead. Now, here’s the way I look at it. Here’s this chap come to the throne after his old"
"2111";"12";"289";"mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey. He’s a man of the world, and he means well by us. He’s a jolly fine"
"2112";"12";"290";"decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him. He just says to himself: ""˜The old one never went to see these"

"2119";"12";"297";"play fair?"""
"2120";"12";"298";"“That’s all very fine,"" said Mr. Lyons. “But look at the case of Parnell now."""

"2122";"12";"300";"“What I mean,"" said Mr. Lyons, “is we have our ideals. Why, now, would we welcome a man like that? Do you think now after"

"2124";"12";"302";"“This is Parnell’s anniversary,"" said Mr. O’Connor, “and don’t let us stir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that"
"2125";"12";"303";"he’s dead and gone - even the Conservatives,"" he added, turning to Mr. Crofton."
"2126";"12";"304";"Pok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr. Crofton’s bottle. Mr. Crofton got up from his box and went to the fire. As he"
"2127";"12";"305";"returned with his capture he said in a deep voice:"
"2128";"12";"306";"“Our side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman."""
"2129";"12";"307";"“Right you are, Crofton!"" said Mr. Henchy fiercely. “He was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order."

"2135";"12";"313";"The old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob."
"2136";"12";"314";"“Sit down, Joe,"" said Mr. O’Connor, “we’re just talking about the Chief."""
"2137";"12";"315";"“Ay, ay!"" said Mr. Henchy."
"2138";"12";"316";"Mr. Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr. Lyons but said nothing."
"2139";"12";"317";"“There’s one of them, anyhow,"" said Mr. Henchy, “that didn’t renege him. By God, I’ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you"
"2140";"12";"318";"stuck to him like a man!"""
"2141";"12";"319";"“0, Joe,"" said Mr. O’Connor suddenly. “Give us that thing you wrote - do you remember? Have you got it on you?"""

"2144";"12";"322";"Mr. Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding, but, after reflecting a while, he"
"2145";"12";"323";"said:"
"2146";"12";"324";"“O, that thing is it.... Sure, that’s old now."""
"2147";"12";"325";"“Out with it, man!"" said Mr. O’Connor."

"2149";"12";"327";"Mr. Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He"
"2150";"12";"328";"seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced:"
"2151";"12";"329";"THE DEATH OF PARNELL"
"2152";"12";"330";"6th October, 1891"
"2153";"12";"331";"He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:"

"2155";"12";"333";"O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe"
"2156";"12";"334";"For he lies dead whom the fell gang"
"2157";"12";"335";"Of modern hypocrites laid low."
"2158";"12";"336";"He lies slain by the coward hounds"
"2159";"12";"337";"He raised to glory from the mire;"

"2170";"12";"348";"He dreamed (alas, ’twas but a dream!)"
"2171";"12";"349";"Of Liberty: but as he strove"
"2172";"12";"350";"To clutch that idol, treachery"
"2173";"12";"351";"Sundered him from the thing he loved."
"2174";"12";"352";"Shame on the coward, caitiff hands"
"2175";"12";"353";"That smote their Lord or with a kiss"

"2186";"12";"364";"No sound of strife disturb his sleep!"
"2187";"12";"365";"Calmly he rests: no human pain"

"2197";"12";"375";"One grief - the memory of Parnell."
"2198";"12";"376";"Mr. Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of"
"2199";"12";"377";"clapping: even Mr. Lyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When it had ceased all the auditors drank from"
"2200";"12";"378";"their bottles in silence."
"2201";"12";"379";"Pok! The cork flew out of Mr. Hynes’ bottle, but Mr. Hynes remained sitting flushed and bare-headed on the table. He did"
"2202";"12";"380";"not seem to have heard the invitation."
"2203";"12";"381";"“Good man, Joe!"" said Mr. O’Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion."
"2204";"12";"382";"“What do you think of that, Crofton?"" cried Mr. Henchy. “Isn’t that fine? What?"""
"2205";"12";"383";"Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing."
"2206";"13";"2";"Miss Devlin had become Mrs. Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned"
"2207";"13";"3";"French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age"
"2208";"13";"4";"of marriage she was sent out to many houses, where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly"
"2209";"13";"5";"circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom"
"2210";"13";"6";"she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of"
"2211";"13";"7";"Turkish Delight in secret. However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her,"
"2212";"13";"8";"she silenced them by marrying Mr. Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay."
"2213";"13";"9";"He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After"
"2214";"13";"10";"the first year of married life, Mrs. Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she"
"2215";"13";"11";"never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes"
"2216";"13";"12";"with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange"
"2217";"13";"13";"house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put"
"2218";"13";"14";"the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum"
"2219";"13";"15";"every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of"
"2220";"13";"16";"twenty-four. He sent the older daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid"
"2221";"13";"17";"her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs. Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:"
"2222";"13";"18";"“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks."""
"2223";"13";"19";"If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones."
"2224";"13";"20";"When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs. Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter’s name and"
"2225";"13";"21";"brought an Irish teacher to the house. Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these"
"2226";"13";"22";"friends sent back other Irish picture postcards. On special Sundays, when Mr. Kearney went with his family to the"
"2227";"13";"23";"pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends"
"2228";"13";"24";"of the Kearneys - musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they"
"2229";"13";"25";"shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so man hands, and said good-bye to one another in"
"2230";"13";"26";"Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people’s lips. People said that she was very clever"
"2231";"13";"27";"at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs. Kearney was well content"
"2232";"13";"28";"at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr. Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the"
"2233";"13";"29";"accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought"
"2234";"13";"30";"him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart"
"2235";"13";"31";"and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded: and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen"
"2236";"13";"32";"was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts."
"2237";"13";"33";"As Mr. Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme,"
"2238";"13";"34";"Mrs. Kearney helped him. She had tact. She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small"
"2239";"13";"35";"type. She knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr. Meade’s comic turn. To keep the audience continually"
"2240";"13";"36";"diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr. Holohan called to see her every day to have her"
"2241";"13";"37";"advice on some point. She was invariably friendly and advising - homely, in fact. She pushed the decanter towards him,"
"2242";"13";"38";"saying:"
"2243";"13";"39";"“Now, help yourself, Mr. Holohan!"""
"2244";"13";"40";"And while he was helping himself she said:"
"2245";"13";"41";"“Don’t be afraid! Don t be afraid of it! """
"2246";"13";"42";"Everything went on smoothly. Mrs. Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front"
"2247";"13";"43";"of Kathleen’s dress. It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable. She took a dozen"
"2248";"13";"44";"of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise. She"
"2249";"13";"45";"forgot nothing, and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done."
"2250";"13";"46";"The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When Mrs. Kearney arrived with her daughter at the"
"2251";"13";"47";"Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look of things. A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in"
"2252";"13";"48";"their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress. She passed by with her daughter and a quick"
"2253";"13";"49";"glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards’ idleness. At first she wondered had she"
"2254";"13";"50";"mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight."
"2255";"13";"51";"In the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick. She smiled and"
"2256";"13";"52";"shook his hand. He was a little man, with a white, vacant face. She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on"
"2257";"13";"53";"the side of his head and that his accent was flat. He held a programme in his hand, and, while he was talking to her, he"
"2258";"13";"54";"chewed one end of it into a moist pulp. He seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr. Holohan came into the dressingroom"
"2259";"13";"55";"every few minutes with reports from the box-office. The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to"
"2260";"13";"56";"time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began"
"2261";"13";"57";"to express their desire to be entertained. Mr. Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:"
"2262";"13";"58";"“Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we’d better open the ball."""
"2263";"13";"59";"Mrs. Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter"
"2264";"13";"60";"encouragingly:"
"2265";"13";"61";"“Are you ready, dear?"""
"2266";"13";"62";"When she had an opportunity, she called Mr. Holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant. Mr. Holohan did not"
"2267";"13";"63";"know what it meant. He said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many."
"2268";"13";"64";"“And the artistes!"" said Mrs. Kearney. “Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good."""
"2269";"13";"65";"Mr. Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee, he said, had decided to let the first three"
"2270";"13";"66";"concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs. Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre"
"2271";"13";"67";"items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she"
"2272";"13";"68";"had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr."
"2273";"13";"69";"Fitzpatrick’s vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The"
"2274";"13";"70";"concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly."
"2275";"13";"71";"The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs. Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The"
"2276";"13";"72";"audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself;"
"2277";"13";"73";"he was quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from"
"2278";"13";"74";"time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the"
"2279";"13";"75";"evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven"
"2280";"13";"76";"and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr. Holohan. She buttonholed him"
"2281";"13";"77";"as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true. Yes. it was true."
"2282";"13";"78";"“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,"" she said. “The contract was for four concerts."""
"2283";"13";"79";"Mr. Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick. Mrs. Kearney was now beginning to be"
"2284";"13";"80";"alarmed. She called Mr. Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and"
"2285";"13";"81";"that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the"
"2286";"13";"82";"society gave the four concerts or not. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to"
"2287";"13";"83";"resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee. Mrs. Kearney’s anger began to flutter"
"2288";"13";"84";"in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking:"
"2289";"13";"85";"“And who is the Cometty pray?"""
"2290";"13";"86";"But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent."
"2291";"13";"87";"Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special"
"2292";"13";"88";"puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the"
"2293";"13";"89";"following evening. Mrs. Kearney was somewhat reassured, but be thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He"
"2294";"13";"90";"listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night. She agreed. She respected"
"2295";"13";"91";"her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she"
"2296";"13";"92";"knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming"
"2297";"13";"93";"with her. She thought her plans over."
"2298";"13";"94";"The night of the grand concert came. Mrs. Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms"
"2299";"13";"95";"three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs."
"2300";"13";"96";"Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr."
"2301";"13";"97";"Holohan or Mr. Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and,"
"2302";"13";"98";"after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs. Kearney explained that"
"2303";"13";"99";"she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs. Kearney"
"2304";"13";"100";"looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:"
"2305";"13";"101";"“No, thank you!"""
"2306";"13";"102";"The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street"
"2307";"13";"103";"effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said:"
"2308";"13";"104";"“Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows."""
"2309";"13";"105";"Mrs. Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room."
"2310";"13";"106";"The artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already come. The bass, Mr. Duggan, was a slender young man"
"2311";"13";"107";"with a scattered black moustache. He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung"
"2312";"13";"108";"prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall. From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate"
"2313";"13";"109";"artiste. He had appeared in grand opera. One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of"
"2314";"13";"110";"the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen’s Theatre. He sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly"
"2315";"13";"111";"welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or"
"2316";"13";"112";"twice out of thoughtlessness. He was unassuming and spoke little. He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he"
"2317";"13";"113";"never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s sake. Mr. Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who"
"2318";"13";"114";"competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil. On his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal. He was extremely"
"2319";"13";"115";"nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness. It was his"
"2320";"13";"116";"humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him. Therefore when he saw Mr. Duggan he went over to him and"
"2321";"13";"117";"asked:"
"2322";"13";"118";"“Are you in it too? """
"2323";"13";"119";"“Yes,"" said Mr. Duggan."
"2324";"13";"120";"Mr. Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:"
"2325";"13";"121";"“Shake!"""
"2326";"13";"122";"Mrs. Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house. The seats were being"
"2327";"13";"123";"filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately. Their"
"2328";"13";"124";"conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist"
"2329";"13";"125";"friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed"
"2330";"13";"126";"with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the"
"2331";"13";"127";"soprano."
"2332";"13";"128";"“I wonder where did they dig her up,"" said Kathleen to Miss Healy. “I’m sure I never heard of her."""
"2333";"13";"129";"Miss Healy had to smile. Mr. Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who"
"2334";"13";"130";"was the unknown woman. Mr. Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the"
"2335";"13";"131";"room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The"
"2336";"13";"132";"shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the"
"2337";"13";"133";"hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and"
"2338";"13";"134";"complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company."
"2339";"13";"135";"Mrs. Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but,"
"2340";"13";"136";"while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she"
"2341";"13";"137";"excused herself and went out after him."
"2342";"13";"138";"“Mr. Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,"" she said."
"2343";"13";"139";"They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr."
"2344";"13";"140";"Holohan said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs. Kearney said that she didn’t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick."
"2345";"13";"141";"Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that it wasn’t his"
"2346";"13";"142";"business."
"2347";"13";"143";"“Why isn’t it your business?"" asked Mrs. Kearney. “Didn’t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it’s not your"
"2348";"13";"144";"business it’s my business and I mean to see to it."""
"2349";"13";"145";"“You’d better speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick,"" said Mr. Holohan distantly."
"2350";"13";"146";"“I don’t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick,"" repeated Mrs. Kearney. “I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is"
"2351";"13";"147";"carried out."""
"2352";"13";"148";"When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress"
"2353";"13";"149";"had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the Freeman"
"2354";"13";"150";"man and Mr. O’Madden Burke. The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report"
"2355";"13";"151";"the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House. He said they were to leave the report for him at the"
"2356";"13";"152";"Freeman office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He"
"2357";"13";"153";"held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment"
"2358";"13";"154";"because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in"
"2359";"13";"155";"front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to"
"2360";"13";"156";"turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious"
"2361";"13";"157";"that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and"
"2362";"13";"158";"fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully."
"2363";"13";"159";"“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,"" he explained to Mr. Holohan, “and I’ll see it in."""
"2364";"13";"160";"“Thank you very much, Mr. Hendrick,"" said Mr. Holohan. you’ll see it in, I know. Now, won’t you have a little something"
"2365";"13";"161";"before you go?"""
"2366";"13";"162";"“I don’t mind,"" said Mr. Hendrick."
"2367";"13";"163";"The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the"
"2368";"13";"164";"stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr. O’Madden Burke, who had found out the"
"2369";"13";"165";"room by instinct. He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His"
"2370";"13";"166";"magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances. He was widely"
"2371";"13";"167";"respected."
"2372";"13";"168";"While Mr. Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs. Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to"
"2373";"13";"169";"ask her to lower her voice. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. Mr. Bell, the first"
"2374";"13";"170";"item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign. Evidently something was wrong. Mr. Kearney looked"
"2375";"13";"171";"straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs. Kearney spoke into Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis. From the hall"
"2376";"13";"172";"came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together,"
"2377";"13";"173";"waiting tranquilly, but Mr. Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had"
"2378";"13";"174";"come late."
"2379";"13";"175";"Mr. Holohan and Mr. O’Madden Burke came into the room In a moment Mr. Holohan perceived the hush. He went over to Mrs."
"2380";"13";"176";"Kearney and spoke with her earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder. Mr. Holohan became very"
"2381";"13";"177";"red and excited. He spoke volubly, but Mrs. Kearney said curtly at intervals:"
"2382";"13";"178";"“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas."""
"2383";"13";"179";"Mr. Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping. He appealed to Mr Kearney"
"2384";"13";"180";"and to Kathleen. But Mr. Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe:"
"2385";"13";"181";"it was not her fault. Mrs. Kearney repeated:"
"2386";"13";"182";"“She won’t go on without her money."""
"2387";"13";"183";"After a swift struggle of tongues Mr. Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence"
"2388";"13";"184";"had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:"
"2389";"13";"185";"“Have you seen Mrs. Pat Campbell this week?"""
"2390";"13";"186";"The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first"
"2391";"13";"187";"tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming"
"2392";"13";"188";"random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs. Kearney."
"2393";"13";"189";"The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr. Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr. Holohan who"
"2394";"13";"190";"was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr. Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his"
"2395";"13";"191";"hand. He counted out four into Mrs. Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs. Kearney"
"2396";"13";"192";"said:"
"2397";"13";"193";"“This is four shillings short."""
"2398";"13";"194";"But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: “Now. Mr. Bell,"" to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The"
"2399";"13";"195";"singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the"
"2400";"13";"196";"piano was heard."
"2401";"13";"197";"The first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn’s item. The poor lady sang Killarney in a"
"2402";"13";"198";"bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent"
"2403";"13";"199";"elegance to her singing. She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the"
"2404";"13";"200";"hall made fun of her high wailing notes. The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen played"
"2405";"13";"201";"a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded. The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation"
"2406";"13";"202";"delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men"
"2407";"13";"203";"went out for the interval, content."
"2408";"13";"204";"All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. In one corner were Mr. Holohan, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne,"
"2409";"13";"205";"two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr. O’Madden Burke. Mr. O’Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous"
"2410";"13";"206";"exhibition he had ever witnessed. Miss Kathleen Kearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said. The"
"2411";"13";"207";"baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs. Kearney’s conduct. He did not like to say anything. He had been paid his money"
"2412";"13";"208";"and wished to be at peace with men. However, he said that Mrs. Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The"
"2413";"13";"209";"stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came."
"2414";"13";"210";"“I agree with Miss Beirne,"" said Mr. O’Madden Burke. “Pay her nothing."""
"2415";"13";"211";"In another corner of the room were Mrs. Kearney and he: husband, Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to"
"2416";"13";"212";"recite the patriotic piece. Mrs. Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither"
"2417";"13";"213";"trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid."
"2418";"13";"214";"They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show"
"2419";"13";"215";"them their mistake. They wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her"
"2420";"13";"216";"daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t be fooled. If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of"
"2421";"13";"217";"course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he"
"2422";"13";"218";"thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she"
"2423";"13";"219";"did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their"
"2424";"13";"220";"house."
"2425";"13";"221";"As soon as the first part was ended Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Holohan went over to Mrs. Kearney and told her that the other"
"2426";"13";"222";"four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play"
"2427";"13";"223";"for the second part, the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing."
"2428";"13";"224";"“I haven’t seen any committee,"" said Mrs. Kearney angrily. “My daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight"
"2429";"13";"225";"into her hand or a foot she won’t put on that platform."""
"2430";"13";"226";"“I’m surprised at you, Mrs. Kearney,"" said Mr. Holohan. “I never thought you would treat us this way."""
"2431";"13";"227";"“And what way did you treat me?"" asked Mrs. Kearney."
"2432";"13";"228";"Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands."
"2433";"13";"229";"“I’m asking for my rights."" she said."
"2434";"13";"230";"You might have some sense of decency,"" said Mr. Holohan."
"2435";"13";"231";"“Might I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can’t get a civil answer."""
"2436";"13";"232";"She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:"
"2437";"13";"233";"“You must speak to the secretary. It’s not my business. I’m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do."""
"2438";"13";"234";"“I thought you were a lady,"" said Mr. Holohan, walking away from her abruptly."
"2439";"13";"235";"After that Mrs. Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the committee had done. She stood"
"2440";"13";"236";"at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time"
"2441";"13";"237";"for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to"
"2442";"13";"238";"play one or two accompaniments. Mrs. Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the"
"2443";"13";"239";"platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she"
"2444";"13";"240";"caught up her daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:"
"2445";"13";"241";"“Get a cab!"""
"2446";"13";"242";"He went out at once. Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. As she passed through the"
"2447";"13";"243";"doorway she stopped and glared into Mr. Holohan’s face."
"2448";"13";"244";"“I’m not done with you yet,"" she said."
"2449";"13";"245";"“But I’m done with you,"" said Mr. Holohan."
"2450";"13";"246";"Kathleen followed her mother meekly. Mr. Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he his"
"2451";"13";"247";"skin on fire."
"2452";"13";"248";"“That’s a nice lady!"" he said. “O, she’s a nice lady!"""
"2453";"13";"249";"You did the proper thing, Holohan,"" said Mr. O’Madden Burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval."
"2454";"14";"2";"These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In"
"2455";"14";"3";"two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him. No"
"2456";"14";"4";"one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum."
"2457";"14";"5";"“Was he by himself?"" asked the manager."
"2458";"14";"6";"“No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him."""
"2459";"14";"7";"“And where are they?"""
"2460";"14";"8";"No one knew; a voice said:"
"2461";"14";"9";"“Give him air. He’s fainted."""
"2462";"14";"10";"The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically. A dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man’s head"
"2463";"14";"11";"on the tessellated floor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man’s face, sent for a policeman."
"2464";"14";"12";"His collar was unfastened and his necktie undone. He opened eyes for an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of"
"2465";"14";"13";"gentlemen who had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand. The manager asked repeatedly did no one know who"
"2466";"14";"14";"the injured man was or where had his friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered. A crowd"
"2467";"14";"15";"which had followed him down the laneway collected outside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels."
"2468";"14";"16";"The manager at once began to narrate what he knew. The costable, a young man with thick immobile features, listened. He"
"2469";"14";"17";"moved his head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor, as if he feared to be the victim"
"2470";"14";"18";"some delusion. Then he drew off his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked the lead of his pencil and made"
"2471";"14";"19";"ready to indite. He asked in a suspicious provincial accent:"
"2472";"14";"20";"“Who is the man? What’s his name and address?"""
"2473";"14";"21";"A young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders. He knelt down promptly beside the injured"
"2474";"14";"22";"man and called for water. The constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed the blood from the injured man’s mouth"
"2475";"14";"23";"and then called for some brandy. The constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with"
"2476";"14";"24";"the glass. The brandy was forced down the man’s throat. In a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him. He looked"
"2477";"14";"25";"at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to rise to his feet."
"2478";"14";"26";"“You’re all right now?"" asked the young man in the cycling-suit."
"2479";"14";"27";"“Sha,""˜s nothing,"" said the injured man, trying to stand up."
"2480";"14";"28";"He was helped to his feet. The manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice. The"
"2481";"14";"29";"battered silk hat was placed on the man’s head. The constable asked:"
"2482";"14";"30";"“Where do you live?"""
"2483";"14";"31";"The man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache. He made light of his accident. It was nothing, he"
"2484";"14";"32";"said: only a little accident. He spoke very thickly."
"2485";"14";"33";"“Where do you live"" repeated the constable."
"2486";"14";"34";"The man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion,"
"2487";"14";"35";"wearing a long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he called out:"
"2488";"14";"36";"“Hallo, Tom, old man! What’s the trouble?"""
"2489";"14";"37";"“Sha,""˜s nothing,"" said the man."
"2490";"14";"38";"The new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the constable, saying:"
"2491";"14";"39";"“It’s all right, constable. I’ll see him home."""
"2492";"14";"40";"The constable touched his helmet and answered:"
"2493";"14";"41";"“All right, Mr. Power!"""
"2494";"14";"42";"“Come now, Tom,"" said Mr. Power, taking his friend by the arm. “No bones broken. What? Can you walk?"""
"2495";"14";"43";"The young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided."
"2496";"14";"44";"“How did you get yourself into this mess?"" asked Mr. Power."
"2497";"14";"45";"“The gentleman fell down the stairs,"" said the young man."
"2498";"14";"46";"“I’ ""˜ery ""˜uch o’liged to you, sir,"" said the injured man."
"2499";"14";"47";"“Not at all."""
"2500";"14";"48";"“""˜ant we have a little...?"""
"2501";"14";"49";"“Not now. Not now."""
"2502";"14";"50";"The three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors in to the laneway. The manager brought the constable to"
"2503";"14";"51";"the stairs to inspect the scene of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing. The customers"
"2504";"14";"52";"returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor."
"2505";"14";"53";"When they came out into Grafton Street, Mr. Power whistled for an outsider. The injured man said again as well as he"
"2506";"14";"54";"could."
"2507";"14";"55";"“I’ ""˜ery ""˜uch o’liged to you, sir. I hope we’ll ""˜eet again. ""˜y na’e is Kernan."""
"2508";"14";"56";"The shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him."
"2509";"14";"57";"“Don’t mention it,"" said the young man."
"2510";"14";"58";"They shook hands. Mr. Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr. Power was giving directions to the carman, he"
"2511";"14";"59";"expressed his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together."
"2512";"14";"60";"“Another time,"" said the young man."
"2513";"14";"61";"The car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast Office the clock showed half-past nine. A keen east"
"2514";"14";"62";"wind hit them, blowing from the mouth of the river. Mr. Kernan was huddled together with cold. His friend asked him to tell"
"2515";"14";"63";"how the accident had happened."
"2516";"14";"64";"“I’an’t ""˜an,"" he answered, “""˜y ""˜ongue is hurt."""
"2517";"14";"65";"“Show."""
"2518";"14";"66";"The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr. Kernan’s mouth but he could not see. He struck a match and,"
"2519";"14";"67";"sheltering it in the shell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr. Kernan opened obediently. The swaying"
"2520";"14";"68";"movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth. The lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood"
"2521";"14";"69";"and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off. The match was blown out."
"2522";"14";"70";"“That’s ugly,"" said Mr. Power."
"2523";"14";"71";"“Sha, ""˜s nothing,"" said Mr. Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck."
"2524";"14";"72";"Mr. Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never been"
"2525";"14";"73";"seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these two articles of clothing, he"
"2526";"14";"74";"said, a man could always pass muster. He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he"
"2527";"14";"75";"evoked at times by legend and mimicry. Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in"
"2528";"14";"76";"Crowe Street, on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the address - London, E. C. On the"
"2529";"14";"77";"mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window"
"2530";"14";"78";"stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid. From these bowls Mr. Kernan tasted tea. He"
"2531";"14";"79";"took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate. Then he paused to"
"2532";"14";"80";"judge."
"2533";"14";"81";"Mr. Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish Constabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his"
"2534";"14";"82";"social rise intersected the arc of his friend’s decline, but Mr. Kernan’s decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of"
"2535";"14";"83";"those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character. Mr. Power was one of"
"2536";"14";"84";"these friends. His inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle; he was a debonair young man."
"2537";"14";"85";"The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr. Kernan was helped into the house. His wife put him to"
"2538";"14";"86";"bed while Mr. Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in."
"2539";"14";"87";"The children - two girls and a boy, conscious of their father helplessness and of their mother’s absence, began some"
"2540";"14";"88";"horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs."
"2541";"14";"89";"Kernan entered the kitchen, exclaiming:"
"2542";"14";"90";"“Such a sight! O, he’ll do for himself one day and that’s the holy alls of it. He’s been drinking since Friday."""
"2543";"14";"91";"Mr. Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible, that he had come on the scene by the merest"
"2544";"14";"92";"accident. Mrs. Kernan, remembering Mr. Power’s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small, but opportune"
"2545";"14";"93";"loans, said:"
"2546";"14";"94";"“O, you needn’t tell me that, Mr. Power. I know you’re a friend of his, not like some of the others he does be with."
"2547";"14";"95";"They’re all right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family. Nice friends! Who was he"
"2548";"14";"96";"with tonight, I’d like to know?"""
"2549";"14";"97";"Mr. Power shook his head but said nothing."
"2550";"14";"98";"“I’m so sorry,"" she continued, “that I’ve nothing in the house to offer you. But if you wait a minute I’ll send round to"
"2551";"14";"99";"Fogarty’s, at the corner."""
"2552";"14";"100";"Mr. Power stood up."
"2553";"14";"101";"“We were waiting for him to come home with the money. He never seems to think he has a home at all."""
"2554";"14";"102";"“O, now, Mrs. Kernan,"" said Mr. Power, “we’ll make him turn over a new leaf. I’ll talk to Martin. He’s the man. We’ll"
"2555";"14";"103";"come here one of these nights and talk it over."""
"2556";"14";"104";"She saw him to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the footpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself."
"2557";"14";"105";"“It’s very kind of you to bring him home,"" she said."
"2558";"14";"106";"“Not at all,"" said Mr. Power."
"2559";"14";"107";"He got up on the car. As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily."
"2560";"14";"108";"“We’ll make a new man of him,"" he said. “Good-night, Mrs. Kernan."""
"2561";"14";"109";"Mrs. Kernan’s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight. Then she withdrew them, went into the house and"
"2562";"14";"110";"emptied her husband’s pockets."
"2563";"14";"111";"She was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her"
"2564";"14";"112";"intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to Mr. Power’s accompaniment. In her days of courtship, Mr. Kernan had seemed"
"2565";"14";"113";"to her a not ungallant figure: and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the"
"2566";"14";"114";"bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the"
"2567";"14";"115";"arm of a jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat"
"2568";"14";"116";"gracefully balanced upon his other arm. After three weeks she had found a wife’s life irksome and, later on, when she was"
"2569";"14";"117";"beginning to find it unbearable, she had become a mother. The part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties"
"2570";"14";"118";"and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband. Her two eldest sons were launched. One was in a"
"2571";"14";"119";"draper’s shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast. They were good sons, wrote regularly and"
"2572";"14";"120";"sometimes sent home money. The other children were still at school."
"2573";"14";"121";"Mr. Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed. She made beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly."
"2574";"14";"122";"She accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to"
"2575";"14";"123";"make him eat a breakfast. There were worse husbands. He had never been violent since the boys had grown up, and she knew"
"2576";"14";"124";"that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order."
"2577";"14";"125";"Two nights after, his friends came to see him. She brought them up to his bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with"
"2578";"14";"126";"a personal odour, and gave them chairs at the fire. Mr. Kernan’s tongue, the occasional stinging pain of which had made him"
"2579";"14";"127";"somewhat irritable during the day, became more polite. He sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his"
"2580";"14";"128";"puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders. He apologised to his guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same time"
"2581";"14";"129";"looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran’s pride."
"2582";"14";"130";"He was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. M’Coy and Mr. Power had"
"2583";"14";"131";"disclosed to Mrs. Kernan in the parlour. The idea been Mr. Power’s, but its development was entrusted to Mr. Cunningham. Mr."
"2584";"14";"132";"Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his marriage, he had"
"2585";"14";"133";"not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years. He was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism."
"2586";"14";"134";"Mr. Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He was an elder colleague of Mr. Power. His own domestic life was very"
"2587";"14";"135";"happy. People had great sympathy with him, for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable"
"2588";"14";"136";"drunkard. He had set up house for her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him."
"2589";"14";"137";"Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He was a thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent. His blade"
"2590";"14";"138";"of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered"
"2591";"14";"139";"by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy. He was well informed. His friends bowed to his opinions and"
"2592";"14";"140";"considered that his face was like Shakespeare’s."
"2593";"14";"141";"When the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs. Kernan had said:"
"2594";"14";"142";"“I leave it all in your hands, Mr. Cunningham."""
"2595";"14";"143";"After a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions left. Religion for her was a habit, and she"
"2596";"14";"144";"suspected that a man of her husband’s age would not change greatly before death. She was tempted to see a curious"
"2597";"14";"145";"appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded, would have told the gentlemen that Mr."
"2598";"14";"146";"Kernan’s tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr. Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion."
"2599";"14";"147";"The scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were not extravagant. She believed steadily in the"
"2600";"14";"148";"Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments. Her faith was bounded by"
"2601";"14";"149";"her kitchen, but, if she was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost."
"2602";"14";"150";"The gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr. Cunningham said that he had once known a similar case. A man of seventy"
"2603";"14";"151";"had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again, so that no one could see a"
"2604";"14";"152";"trace of the bite."
"2605";"14";"153";"“Well, I’m not seventy,"" said the invalid."
"2606";"14";"154";"“God forbid,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2607";"14";"155";"“It doesn’t pain you now?"" asked Mr. M’Coy."
"2608";"14";"156";"Mr. M’Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children"
"2609";"14";"157";"to play the piano at low terms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods"
"2610";"14";"158";"he had been driven to live by his wits. He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The"
"2611";"14";"159";"Irish Times and for The Freeman’s Journal, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk"
"2612";"14";"160";"in the office of the Sub-Sheriff, and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner. His new office made him"
"2613";"14";"161";"professionally interested in Mr. Kernan’s case."
"2614";"14";"162";"“Pain? Not much,"" answered Mr. Kernan. “But it’s so sickening. I feel as if I wanted to retch off."""
"2615";"14";"163";"“That’s the boose,"" said Mr. Cunningham firmly."
"2616";"14";"164";"“No,"" said Mr. Kernan. “I think I caught cold on the car. There’s something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or"
"2617";"14";"165";"--"""
"2618";"14";"166";"“Mucus."" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2619";"14";"167";"“It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening."""
"2620";"14";"168";"“Yes, yes,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “that’s the thorax."""
"2621";"14";"169";"He looked at Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Power at the same time with an air of challenge. Mr. Cunningham nodded his head"
"2622";"14";"170";"rapidly and Mr. Power said:"
"2623";"14";"171";"“Ah, well, all’s well that ends well."""
"2624";"14";"172";"“I’m very much obliged to you, old man,"" said the invalid."
"2625";"14";"173";"Mr. Power waved his hand."
"2626";"14";"174";"“Those other two fellows I was with --"""
"2627";"14";"175";"“Who were you with?"" asked Mr. Cunningham."
"2628";"14";"176";"“A chap. I don’t know his name. Damn it now, what’s his name? Little chap with sandy hair...."""
"2629";"14";"177";"“And who else?"""
"2630";"14";"178";"“Harford."""
"2631";"14";"179";"“Hm,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2632";"14";"180";"When Mr. Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known that the speaker had secret sources of"
"2633";"14";"181";"information. In this case the monosyllable had a moral intention. Mr. Harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment"
"2634";"14";"182";"which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on"
"2635";"14";"183";"the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers. But his fellow-travellers had"
"2636";"14";"184";"never consented to overlook his origin. He had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen"
"2637";"14";"185";"at usurious interest. Later on he had become the partner of a very fat, short gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, in the Liffey Loan"
"2638";"14";"186";"Bank. Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish ethical code, his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in"
"2639";"14";"187";"person or by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew and an illiterate, and saw divine disapproval"
"2640";"14";"188";"of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son. At other times they remembered his good points."
"2641";"14";"189";"“I wonder where did he go to,"" said Mr. Kernan."
"2642";"14";"190";"He wished the details of the incident to remain vague. He wished his friends to think there had been some mistake, that"
"2643";"14";"191";"Mr. Harford and he had missed each other. His friends, who knew quite well Mr. Harford’s manners in drinking were silent."
"2644";"14";"192";"Mr. Power said again:"
"2645";"14";"193";"“All’s well that ends well."""
"2646";"14";"194";"Mr. Kernan changed the subject at once."
"2647";"14";"195";"“That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,"" he said. “Only for him --"""
"2648";"14";"196";"“O, only for him,"" said Mr. Power, “it might have been a case of seven days, without the option of a fine."""
"2649";"14";"197";"“Yes, yes,"" said Mr. Kernan, trying to remember. “I remember now there was a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed."
"2650";"14";"198";"How did it happen at all?"""
"2651";"14";"199";"“It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,"" said Mr. Cunningham gravely."
"2652";"14";"200";"“True bill,"" said Mr. Kernan, equally gravely."
"2653";"14";"201";"“I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2654";"14";"202";"Mr. Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr. M’Coy"
"2655";"14";"203";"had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs. M’Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in"
"2656";"14";"204";"the country. More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game. He"
"2657";"14";"205";"answered the question, therefore, as if Mr. Kernan had asked it."
"2658";"14";"206";"The narrative made Mr. Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on"
"2659";"14";"207";"terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins."
"2660";"14";"208";"“Is this what we pay rates for?"" he asked. “To feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms... and they’re nothing else."""
"2661";"14";"209";"Mr. Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office hours."
"2662";"14";"210";"“How could they be anything else, Tom?"" he said."
"2663";"14";"211";"He assumed a thick, provincial accent and said in a tone of command:"
"2664";"14";"212";"“65, catch your cabbage!"""
"2665";"14";"213";"Everyone laughed. Mr. M’Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any door, pretended that he had never heard the"
"2666";"14";"214";"story. Mr. Cunningham said:"
"2667";"14";"215";"“It is supposed - they say, you know - to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows,"
"2668";"14";"216";"omadhauns, you know, to drill. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates."""
"2669";"14";"217";"He illustrated the story by grotesque gestures."
"2670";"14";"218";"“At dinner, you know. Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a"
"2671";"14";"219";"shovel. He takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it"
"2672";"14";"220";"on their plates: 65, catch your cabbage."""
"2673";"14";"221";"Everyone laughed again: but Mr. Kernan was somewhat indignant still. He talked of writing a letter to the papers."
"2674";"14";"222";"“These yahoos coming up here,"" he said, “think they can boss the people. I needn’t tell you, Martin, what kind of men"
"2675";"14";"223";"they are."""
"2676";"14";"224";"Mr. Cunningham gave a qualified assent."
"2677";"14";"225";"“It’s like everything else in this world,"" he said. “You get some bad ones and you get some good ones."""
"2678";"14";"226";"“O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,"" said Mr. Kernan, satisfied."
"2679";"14";"227";"“It’s better to have nothing to say to them,"" said Mr. M’Coy. “That’s my opinion!"""
"2680";"14";"228";"Mrs. Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:"
"2681";"14";"229";"“Help yourselves, gentlemen."""
"2682";"14";"230";"Mr. Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair. She declined it, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after"
"2683";"14";"231";"having exchanged a nod with Mr. Cunningham behind Mr. Power’s back, prepared to leave the room. Her husband called out to"
"2684";"14";"232";"her:"
"2685";"14";"233";"“And have you nothing for me, duckie?"""
"2686";"14";"234";"“O, you! The back of my hand to you!"" said Mrs. Kernan tartly."
"2687";"14";"235";"Her husband called after her:"
"2688";"14";"236";"“Nothing for poor little hubby!"""
"2689";"14";"237";"He assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general"
"2690";"14";"238";"merriment."
"2691";"14";"239";"The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the table and paused. Then Mr. Cunningham turned towards"
"2692";"14";"240";"Mr. Power and said casually:"
"2693";"14";"241";"“On Thursday night, you said, Jack """
"2694";"14";"242";"“Thursday, yes,"" said Mr. Power."
"2695";"14";"243";"“Righto!"" said Mr. Cunningham promptly."
"2696";"14";"244";"“We can meet in M’Auley’s,"" said Mr. M’Coy. “That’ll be the most convenient place."""
"2697";"14";"245";"“But we mustn’t be late,"" said Mr. Power earnestly, “because it is sure to be crammed to the doors."""
"2698";"14";"246";"“We can meet at half-seven,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2699";"14";"247";"“Righto!"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2700";"14";"248";"“Half-seven at M’Auley’s be it!"""
"2701";"14";"249";"There was a short silence. Mr. Kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friends’ confidence. Then he"
"2702";"14";"250";"asked:"
"2703";"14";"251";"“What’s in the wind?"""
"2704";"14";"252";"“O, it’s nothing,"" said Mr. Cunningham. “It’s only a little matter that we’re arranging about for Thursday."""
"2705";"14";"253";"“The opera, is it?"" said Mr. Kernan."
"2706";"14";"254";"“No, no,"" said Mr. Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s just a little... spiritual matter."""
"2707";"14";"255";"“0,"" said Mr. Kernan."
"2708";"14";"256";"There was silence again. Then Mr. Power said, point blank:"
"2709";"14";"257";"“To tell you the truth, Tom, we’re going to make a retreat."""
"2710";"14";"258";"“Yes, that’s it,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “Jack and I and M’Coy here - we’re all going to wash the pot."""
"2711";"14";"259";"He uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by his own voice, proceeded:"
"2712";"14";"260";"“You see, we may as well all admit we’re a nice collection of scoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,"" he added with"
"2713";"14";"261";"gruff charity and turning to Mr. Power. “Own up now!"""
"2714";"14";"262";"“I own up,"" said Mr. Power."
"2715";"14";"263";"“And I own up,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2716";"14";"264";"“So we’re going to wash the pot together,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2717";"14";"265";"A thought seemed to strike him. He turned suddenly to the invalid and said:"
"2718";"14";"266";"“D’ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me? You night join in and we’d have a four-handed reel."""
"2719";"14";"267";"“Good idea,"" said Mr. Power. “The four of us together."""
"2720";"14";"268";"Mr. Kernan was silent. The proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind, but, understanding that some spiritual"
"2721";"14";"269";"agencies were about to concern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff neck. He took"
"2722";"14";"270";"no part in the conversation for a long while, but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his friends discussed the"
"2723";"14";"271";"Jesuits."
"2724";"14";"272";"“I haven’t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,"" he said, intervening at length. “They’re an educated order. I believe they"
"2725";"14";"273";"mean well, too."""
"2726";"14";"274";"“They’re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,"" said Mr. Cunningham, with enthusiasm. “The General of the Jesuits stands"
"2727";"14";"275";"next to the Pope."""
"2728";"14";"276";"“There’s no mistake about it,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “if you want a thing well done and no flies about, you go to a Jesuit."
"2729";"14";"277";"They’re the boyos have influence. I’ll tell you a case in point...."""
"2730";"14";"278";"“The Jesuits are a fine body of men,"" said Mr. Power."
"2731";"14";"279";"“It’s a curious thing,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “about the Jesuit Order. Every other order of the Church had to be reformed"
"2732";"14";"280";"at some time or other but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed. It never fell away."""
"2733";"14";"281";"“Is that so?"" asked Mr. M’Coy."
"2734";"14";"282";"“That’s a fact,"" said Mr. Cunningham. “That’s history."""
"2735";"14";"283";"“Look at their church, too,"" said Mr. Power. “Look at the congregation they have."""
"2736";"14";"284";"“The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2737";"14";"285";"“Of course,"" said Mr. Power."
"2738";"14";"286";"“Yes,"" said Mr. Kernan. “That’s why I have a feeling for them. It’s some of those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious"
"2739";"14";"287";"--"""
"2740";"14";"288";"“They’re all good men,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “each in his own way. The Irish priesthood is honoured all the world"
"2741";"14";"289";"over."""
"2742";"14";"290";"“O yes,"" said Mr. Power."
"2743";"14";"291";"“Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “unworthy of the name."""
"2744";"14";"292";"“Perhaps you’re right,"" said Mr. Kernan, relenting."
"2745";"14";"293";"“Of course I’m right,"" said Mr. Cunningham. “I haven’t been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without"
"2746";"14";"294";"being a judge of character."""
"2747";"14";"295";"The gentlemen drank again, one following another’s example. Mr. Kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind. He"
"2748";"14";"296";"was impressed. He had a high opinion of Mr. Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces. He asked for"
"2749";"14";"297";"particulars."
"2750";"14";"298";"“O, it’s just a retreat, you know,"" said Mr. Cunningham. “Father Purdon is giving it. It’s for business men, you"
"2751";"14";"299";"know."""
"2752";"14";"300";"“He won’t be too hard on us, Tom,"" said Mr. Power persuasively."
"2753";"14";"301";"“Father Purdon? Father Purdon?"" said the invalid."
"2754";"14";"302";"“O, you must know him, Tom,"" said Mr. Cunningham stoutly. “Fine, jolly fellow! He’s a man of the world like"
"2755";"14";"303";"ourselves."""
"2756";"14";"304";"“Ah,... yes. I think I know him. Rather red face; tall."""
"2757";"14";"305";"“That’s the man."""
"2758";"14";"306";"“And tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?"""
"2759";"14";"307";"“Munno.... It’s not exactly a sermon, you know. It’s just kind of a friendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way."""
"2760";"14";"308";"Mr. Kernan deliberated. Mr. M’Coy said:"
"2761";"14";"309";"“Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!"""
"2762";"14";"310";"“O, Father Tom Burke,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “that was a born orator. Did you ever hear him, Tom?"""
"2763";"14";"311";"“Did I ever hear him!"" said the invalid, nettled. “Rather! I heard him...."""
"2764";"14";"312";"“And yet they say he wasn’t much of a theologian,"" said Mr Cunningham."
"2765";"14";"313";"“Is that so?"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2766";"14";"314";"“O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he didn’t preach what was quite orthodox."""
"2767";"14";"315";"“Ah!... he was a splendid man,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2768";"14";"316";"“I heard him once,"" Mr. Kernan continued. “I forget the subject of his discourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of"
"2769";"14";"317";"the... pit, you know... the --"""
"2770";"14";"318";"“The body,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2771";"14";"319";"“Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what.... O yes, it was on the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon"
"2772";"14";"320";"my word it was magnificent, the style of the oratory. And his voice! God! hadn’t he a voice! The Prisoner of the Vatican, he"
"2773";"14";"321";"called him. I remember Crofton saying to me when we came out --"""
"2774";"14";"322";"“But he’s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn’t he?"" said Mr. Power."
"2775";"14";"323";"“""˜Course he is,"" said Mr. Kernan, “and a damned decent Orangeman too. We went into Butler’s in Moore Street - faith, was"
"2776";"14";"324";"genuinely moved, tell you the God’s truth - and I remember well his very words. Kernan, he said, we worship at different"
"2777";"14";"325";"altars, he said, but our belief is the same. Struck me as very well put."""
"2778";"14";"326";"“There’s a good deal in that,"" said Mr. Power. “There used always be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom"
"2779";"14";"327";"was preaching."""
"2780";"14";"328";"“There’s not much difference between us,"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2781";"14";"329";"“We both believe in --"""
"2782";"14";"330";"He hesitated for a moment."
"2783";"14";"331";"“... in the Redeemer. Only they don’t believe in the Pope and in the mother of God."""
"2784";"14";"332";"“But, of course,"" said Mr. Cunningham quietly and effectively, “our religion is the religion, the old, original"
"2785";"14";"333";"faith."""
"2786";"14";"334";"“Not a doubt of it,"" said Mr. Kernan warmly."
"2787";"14";"335";"Mrs. Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:"
"2788";"14";"336";"“Here’s a visitor for you!"""
"2789";"14";"337";"“Who is it?"""
"2790";"14";"338";"“Mr. Fogarty."""
"2791";"14";"339";"“O, come in! come in!"""
"2792";"14";"340";"A pale, oval face came forward into the light. The arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows"
"2793";"14";"341";"looped above pleasantly astonished eyes. Mr. Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had failed in business in a licensed house in"
"2794";"14";"342";"the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers and brewers. He had"
"2795";"14";"343";"opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he flattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives of"
"2796";"14";"344";"the district. He bore himself with a certain grace, complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was"
"2797";"14";"345";"not without culture."
"2798";"14";"346";"Mr. Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky. He inquired politely for Mr. Kernan, placed his gift"
"2799";"14";"347";"on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms. Mr. Kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware"
"2800";"14";"348";"that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and Mr. Fogarty. He said:"
"2801";"14";"349";"“I wouldn’t doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?"""
"2802";"14";"350";"Mr. Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out. This new influence"
"2803";"14";"351";"enlivened the conversation. Mr. Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was specially interested."
"2804";"14";"352";"“Pope Leo XIII,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “was one of the lights of the age. His great idea, you know, was the union of the"
"2805";"14";"353";"Latin and Greek Churches. That was the aim of his life."""
"2806";"14";"354";"“I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,"" said Mr. Power. “I mean, apart from his being"
"2807";"14";"355";"Pope."""
"2808";"14";"356";"“So he was,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “if not the most so. His motto, you know, as Pope, was Lux upon Lux - Light upon"
"2809";"14";"357";"Light."""
"2810";"14";"358";"“No, no,"" said Mr. Fogarty eagerly. “I think you’re wrong there. It was Lux in Tenebris, I think - Light in"
"2811";"14";"359";"Darkness."""
"2812";"14";"360";"“O yes,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “Tenebrae."""
"2813";"14";"361";"“Allow me,"" said Mr. Cunningham positively, “it was Lux upon Lux. And Pius IX his predecessor’s motto was Crux upon Crux"
"2814";"14";"362";"- that is, Cross upon Cross - to show the difference between their two pontificates."""
"2815";"14";"363";"The inference was allowed. Mr. Cunningham continued."
"2816";"14";"364";"“Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet."""
"2817";"14";"365";"“He had a strong face,"" said Mr. Kernan."
"2818";"14";"366";"“Yes,"" said Mr. Cunningham. “He wrote Latin poetry."""
"2819";"14";"367";"“Is that so?"" said Mr. Fogarty."
"2820";"14";"368";"Mr. M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double intention, saying:"
"2821";"14";"369";"“That’s no joke, I can tell you."""
"2822";"14";"370";"“We didn’t learn that, Tom,"" said Mr. Power, following Mr. M’Coy’s example, “when we went to the penny-a-week"
"2823";"14";"371";"school."""
"2824";"14";"372";"“There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of turf under his oxter,"" said Mr. Kernan"
"2825";"14";"373";"sententiously. “The old system was the best: plain honest education. None of your modern trumpery...."""
"2826";"14";"374";"“Quite right,"" said Mr. Power."
"2827";"14";"375";"“No superfluities,"" said Mr. Fogarty."
"2828";"14";"376";"He enunciated the word and then drank gravely."
"2829";"14";"377";"“I remember reading,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “that one of Pope Leo’s poems was on the invention of the photograph - in"
"2830";"14";"378";"Latin, of course."""
"2831";"14";"379";"“On the photograph!"" exclaimed Mr. Kernan."
"2832";"14";"380";"“Yes,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2833";"14";"381";"He also drank from his glass."
"2834";"14";"382";"“Well, you know,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “isn’t the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it?"""
"2835";"14";"383";"“O, of course,"" said Mr. Power, “great minds can see things."""
"2836";"14";"384";"“As the poet says: Great minds are very near to madness,"" said Mr. Fogarty."
"2837";"14";"385";"Mr. Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He made an effort to recall the Protestant theology on some thorny points and"
"2838";"14";"386";"in the end addressed Mr. Cunningham."
"2839";"14";"387";"“Tell me, Martin,"" he said. “Weren’t some of the popes - of course, not our present man, or his predecessor, but some of"
"2840";"14";"388";"the old popes - not exactly ... you know... up to the knocker?"""
"2841";"14";"389";"There was a silence. Mr. Cunningham said"
"2842";"14";"390";"“O, of course, there were some bad lots... But the astonishing thing is this. Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard,"
"2843";"14";"391";"not the most... out-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine. Now isn’t that an"
"2844";"14";"392";"astonishing thing?"""
"2845";"14";"393";"“That is,"" said Mr. Kernan."
"2846";"14";"394";"“Yes, because when the Pope speaks ex cathedra,"" Mr. Fogarty explained, “he is infallible."""
"2847";"14";"395";"“Yes,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2848";"14";"396";"“O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was younger then.... Or was it that --?"""
"2849";"14";"397";"Mr. Fogarty interrupted. He took up the bottle and helped the others to a little more. Mr. M’Coy, seeing that there was"
"2850";"14";"398";"not enough to go round, pleaded that he had not finished his first measure. The others accepted under protest. The light"
"2851";"14";"399";"music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude."
"2852";"14";"400";"“What’s that you were saying, Tom?"" asked Mr. M’Coy."
"2853";"14";"401";"“Papal infallibility,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the Church."""
"2854";"14";"402";"“How was that, Martin?"" asked Mr. Power."
"2855";"14";"403";"Mr. Cunningham held up two thick fingers."
"2856";"14";"404";"“In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two men who held out against it"
"2857";"14";"405";"while the others were all for it. The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No! They wouldn’t have it!"""
"2858";"14";"406";"“Ha!"" said Mr. M’Coy."
"2859";"14";"407";"“And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling... or Dowling... or --"""
"2860";"14";"408";"“Dowling was no German, and that’s a sure five,"" said Mr. Power, laughing."
"2861";"14";"409";"“Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and the other was John MacHale."""
"2862";"14";"410";"“What?"" cried Mr. Kernan. “Is it John of Tuam?"""
"2863";"14";"411";"“Are you sure of that now?"" asked Mr. Fogarty dubiously. “I thought it was some Italian or American."""
"2864";"14";"412";"“John of Tuam,"" repeated Mr. Cunningham, “was the man."""
"2865";"14";"413";"He drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead. Then he resumed:"

"2868";"14";"416";"On the very moment John MacHale, who had been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with the voice of a"
"2869";"14";"417";"lion: ""˜Credo!’"""
"2870";"14";"418";"“I believe!"" said Mr. Fogarty."
"2871";"14";"419";"“Credo!"" said Mr. Cunningham “That showed the faith he had. He submitted the moment the Pope spoke."""
"2872";"14";"420";"“And what about Dowling?"" asked Mr. M’Coy."
"2873";"14";"421";"“The German cardinal wouldn’t submit. He left the church."""
"2874";"14";"422";"Mr. Cunningham’s words had built up the vast image of the church in the minds of his hearers. His deep, raucous voice had"
"2875";"14";"423";"thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs. Kernan came into the room, drying her hands she"
"2876";"14";"424";"came into a solemn company. She did not disturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed."
"2877";"14";"425";"“I once saw John MacHale,"" said Mr. Kernan, “and I’ll never forget it as long as I live."""
"2878";"14";"426";"He turned towards his wife to be confirmed."
"2879";"14";"427";"“I often told you that?"""
"2880";"14";"428";"Mrs. Kernan nodded."
"2881";"14";"429";"“It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray’s statue. Edmund Dwyer Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this"
"2882";"14";"430";"old fellow, crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows."""
"2883";"14";"431";"Mr. Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull, glared at his wife."
"2884";"14";"432";"“God!"" he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, “I never saw such an eye in a man’s head. It was as much as to say: I"
"2885";"14";"433";"have you properly taped, my lad. He had an eye like a hawk."""
"2886";"14";"434";"“None of the Grays was any good,"" said Mr. Power."
"2887";"14";"435";"There was a pause again. Mr. Power turned to Mrs. Kernan and said with abrupt joviality:"
"2888";"14";"436";"“Well, Mrs. Kernan, we’re going to make your man here a good holy pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic."""
"2889";"14";"437";"He swept his arm round the company inclusively."
"2890";"14";"438";"“We’re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins - and God knows we want it badly."""
"2891";"14";"439";"“I don’t mind,"" said Mr. Kernan, smiling a little nervously."
"2892";"14";"440";"Mrs. Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So she said:"
"2893";"14";"441";"“I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale."""
"2894";"14";"442";"Mr. Kernan’s expression changed."
"2895";"14";"443";"“If he doesn’t like it,"" he said bluntly, “he can... do the other thing. I’ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I’m"
"2896";"14";"444";"not such a bad fellow --"""
"2897";"14";"445";"Mr. Cunningham intervened promptly."
"2898";"14";"446";"“We’ll all renounce the devil,"" he said, “together, not forgetting his works and pomps."""
"2899";"14";"447";"“Get behind me, Satan!"" said Mr. Fogarty, laughing and looking at the others."
"2900";"14";"448";"Mr. Power said nothing. He felt completely out-generalled. But a pleased expression flickered across his face."
"2901";"14";"449";"“All we have to do,"" said Mr. Cunningham, “is to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal"
"2902";"14";"450";"vows."""
"2903";"14";"451";"“O, don’t forget the candle, Tom,"" said Mr. M’Coy, “whatever you do."""
"2904";"14";"452";"“What?"" said Mr. Kernan. “Must I have a candle?"""
"2905";"14";"453";"“O yes,"" said Mr. Cunningham."
"2906";"14";"454";"“No, damn it all,"" said Mr. Kernan sensibly, “I draw the line there. I’ll do the job right enough. I’ll do the retreat"
"2907";"14";"455";"business and confession, and... all that business. But... no candles! No, damn it all, I bar the candles!"""
"2908";"14";"456";"He shook his head with farcical gravity."
"2909";"14";"457";"“Listen to that!"" said his wife."
"2910";"14";"458";"“I bar the candles,"" said Mr. Kernan, conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his"
"2911";"14";"459";"head to and fro. “I bar the magic-lantern business."""
"2912";"14";"460";"Everyone laughed heartily."
"2913";"14";"461";"“There’s a nice Catholic for you!"" said his wife."
"2914";"14";"462";"“No candles!"" repeated Mr. Kernan obdurately. “That’s off!"""
"2915";"14";"463";"The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full; and still at every moment gentlemen entered from"
"2916";"14";"464";"the side door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation."
"2917";"14";"465";"The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes"
"2918";"14";"466";"and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases."
"2919";"14";"467";"The gentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security."
"2920";"14";"468";"They sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar."
"2921";"14";"469";"In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Kernan. In the bench behind sat Mr. M’Coy alone: and in"
"2922";"14";"470";"the bench behind him sat Mr. Power and Mr. Fogarty. Mr. M’Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the"
"2923";"14";"471";"others, and, when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks."
"2924";"14";"472";"As these had not been well received, he had desisted. Even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to"
"2925";"14";"473";"respond to the religious stimulus. In a whisper, Mr. Cunningham drew Mr. Kernan’s attention to Mr. Harford, the moneylender,"
"2926";"14";"474";"who sat some distance off, and to Mr. Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who was sitting"
"2927";"14";"475";"immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes,"
"2928";"14";"476";"the owner of three pawnbroker’s shops, and Dan Hogan’s nephew, who was up for the job in the Town Clerk’s office. Farther in"
"2929";"14";"477";"front sat Mr. Hendrick, the chief reporter of The Freeman’s Journal, and poor O’Carroll, an old friend of Mr. Kernan’s, who"
"2930";"14";"478";"had been at one time a considerable commercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr. Kernan began to feel"
"2931";"14";"479";"more at home. His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his wife, rested upon his knees. Once or twice he pulled down his"
"2932";"14";"480";"cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the other hand."
"2933";"14";"481";"A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice, was observed to be struggling into"
"2934";"14";"482";"the pulpit. Simultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care. Mr. Kernan"
"2935";"14";"483";"followed the general example. The priest’s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a"
"2936";"14";"484";"massive red face, appearing above the balustrade."
"2937";"14";"485";"Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and, covering his face with his hands, prayed. After an"
"2938";"14";"486";"interval, he uncovered his face and rose. The congregation rose also and settled again on its benches. Mr. Kernan restored"
"2939";"14";"487";"his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher. The preacher turned back each"
"2940";"14";"488";"wide sleeve of his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces. Then he said:"
"2941";"14";"489";"“For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. Wherefore make unto yourselves"
"2942";"14";"490";"friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings."""
"2943";"14";"491";"Father Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance. It was one of the most difficult texts in all the Scriptures,"
"2944";"14";"492";"he said, to interpret properly. It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality"
"2945";"14";"493";"elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ. But, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance"
"2946";"14";"494";"of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of"
"2947";"14";"495";"worldlings. It was a text for business men and professional men. Jesus Christ with His divine understanding of every cranny"
"2948";"14";"496";"of our human nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were"
"2949";"14";"497";"forced to live in the world, and, to a certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word"
"2950";"14";"498";"of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the"
"2951";"14";"499";"least solicitous in matters religious."
"2952";"14";"500";"He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world"
"2953";"14";"501";"speaking to his fellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way. If he might"
"2954";"14";"502";"use the metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his"
"2955";"14";"503";"books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience."
"2956";"14";"504";"Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen"
"2957";"14";"505";"nature, understood the temptations of this life. We might have had, we all had from time to time, our temptations: we might"
"2958";"14";"506";"have, we all had, our failings. But one thing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers. And that was: to be straight and"
"2959";"14";"507";"manly with God. If their accounts tallied in every point to say:"
"2960";"14";"508";"“Well, I have verified my accounts. I find all well."""
"2961";"14";"509";"But if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the truth, to be frank and say like a man:"
"2962";"14";"510";"“Well, I have looked into my accounts. I find this wrong and this wrong. But, with God’s grace, I will rectify this and"
"2963";"14";"511";"this. I will set right my accounts."""
"2964";"15";"2";"It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan’s annual dance. Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the"
"2965";"15";"3";"family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia’s choir, any of Kate’s pupils that were grown up enough, and even"
"2966";"15";"4";"some of Mary Jane’s pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as"
"2967";"15";"5";"long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney"
"2968";"15";"6";"Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher’s Island, the upper part"
"2969";"15";"7";"of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a"
"2970";"15";"8";"day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ"
"2971";"15";"9";"in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils’ concert every year in the upper room of the Antient"
"2972";"15";"10";"Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were,"
"2973";"15";"11";"her aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve’s, and Kate,"
"2974";"15";"12";"being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. Lily, the"
"2975";"15";"13";"caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them. Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of"
"2976";"15";"14";"everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the"
"2977";"15";"15";"orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not"
"2978";"15";"16";"stand was back answers."
"2979";"15";"17";"Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o’clock and yet there was no"
"2980";"15";"18";"sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not"
"2981";"15";"19";"wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane’s pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was"
"2982";"15";"20";"sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that"
"2983";"15";"21";"was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come."
"2984";"15";"22";"“O, Mr. Conroy,"" said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, “Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never"
"2985";"15";"23";"coming. Good-night, Mrs. Conroy."""
"2986";"15";"24";"“I’ll engage they did,"" said Gabriel, “but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself."""
"2987";"15";"25";"He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called"
"2988";"15";"26";"out:"
"2989";"15";"27";"“Miss Kate, here’s Mrs. Conroy."""
"2990";"15";"28";"Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel’s wife, said she must be perished"
"2991";"15";"29";"alive, and asked was Gabriel with her."
"2992";"15";"30";"“Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I’ll follow,"" called out Gabriel from the dark."
"2993";"15";"31";"He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies’ dressing-room. A"
"2994";"15";"32";"light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as"
"2995";"15";"33";"the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from"
"2996";"15";"34";"out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds."
"2997";"15";"35";"“Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?"" asked Lily."
"2998";"15";"36";"She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had"
"2999";"15";"37";"given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim; growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas"
"3000";"15";"38";"in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step"
"3001";"15";"39";"nursing a rag doll."
"3002";"15";"40";"“Yes, Lily,"" he answered, “and I think we’re in for a night of it."""
"3003";"15";"41";"He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above,"
"3004";"15";"42";"listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a"
"3005";"15";"43";"shelf."
"3006";"15";"44";"“Tell me. Lily,"" he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to school?"""
"3007";"15";"45";"“O no, sir,"" she answered. “I’m done schooling this year and more."""
"3008";"15";"46";"“O, then,"" said Gabriel gaily, “I suppose we’ll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?"
"3009";"15";"47";""""
"3010";"15";"48";"The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:"
"3011";"15";"49";"“The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you."""
"3012";"15";"50";"Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked"
"3013";"15";"51";"actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes."
"3014";"15";"52";"He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered"
"3015";"15";"53";"itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and"
"3016";"15";"54";"the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was parted in the"
"3017";"15";"55";"middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat."
"3018";"15";"56";"When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then"
"3019";"15";"57";"he took a coin rapidly from his pocket."
"3020";"15";"58";"“O Lily,"" he said, thrusting it into her hands, “it’s Christmastime, isn’t it? Just... here’s a little...."""
"3021";"15";"59";"He walked rapidly towards the door."
"3022";"15";"60";"“O no, sir!"" cried the girl, following him. “Really, sir, I wouldn’t take it."""
"3023";"15";"61";"“Christmas-time! Christmas-time!"" said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in"
"3024";"15";"62";"deprecation."
"3025";"15";"63";"The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:"
"3026";"15";"64";"“Well, thank you, sir."""
"3027";"15";"65";"He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and"
"3028";"15";"66";"to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl’s bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him"
"3029";"15";"67";"which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little"
"3030";"15";"68";"paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he"
"3031";"15";"69";"feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the"
"3032";"15";"70";"Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men’s heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that"
"3033";"15";"71";"their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could"
"3034";"15";"72";"not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed"
"3035";"15";"73";"with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter"
"3036";"15";"74";"failure."
"3037";"15";"75";"Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies’ dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old"
"3038";"15";"76";"women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with"
"3039";"15";"77";"darker shadows, was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips"
"3040";"15";"78";"gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her"
"3041";"15";"79";"face, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the"
"3042";"15";"80";"same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour."
"3043";"15";"81";"They both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had"
"3044";"15";"82";"married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks."
"3045";"15";"83";"“Gretta tells me you’re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate."
"3046";"15";"84";"“No,"" said Gabriel, turning to his wife, “we had quite enough of that last year, hadn’t we? Don’t you remember, Aunt"
"3047";"15";"85";"Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed"
"3048";"15";"86";"Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold."""
"3049";"15";"87";"Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word."
"3050";"15";"88";"“Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,"" she said. “You can’t be too careful."""
"3051";"15";"89";"“But as for Gretta there,"" said Gabriel, “she’d walk home in the snow if she were let."""
"3052";"15";"90";"Mrs. Conroy laughed."
"3053";"15";"91";"“Don’t mind him, Aunt Kate,"" she said. “He’s really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom’s eyes at night and"
"3054";"15";"92";"making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!..."
"3055";"15";"93";"O, but you’ll never guess what he makes me wear now!"""
"3056";"15";"94";"She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from"
"3057";"15";"95";"her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel’s solicitude was a standing joke with"
"3058";"15";"96";"them."
"3059";"15";"97";"“Goloshes!"" said Mrs. Conroy. “That’s the latest. Whenever it’s wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he"
"3060";"15";"98";"wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn’t. The next thing he’ll buy me will be a diving suit."""
"3061";"15";"99";"Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she"
"3062";"15";"100";"enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew’s face."
"3063";"15";"101";"After a pause she asked:"
"3064";"15";"102";"“And what are goloshes, Gabriel?"""
"3065";"15";"103";"“Goloshes, Julia!"" exclaimed her sister “Goodness me, don’t you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your... over"
"3066";"15";"104";"your boots, Gretta, isn’t it?"""
"3067";"15";"105";"“Yes,"" said Mrs. Conroy. “Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the"
"3068";"15";"106";"Continent."""
"3069";"15";"107";"“O, on the Continent,"" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly."
"3070";"15";"108";"Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:"
"3071";"15";"109";"“It’s nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy"
"3072";"15";"110";"Minstrels."""
"3073";"15";"111";"“But tell me, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. “Of course, you’ve seen about the room. Gretta was"
"3074";"15";"112";"saying..."""
"3075";"15";"113";"“0, the room is all right,"" replied Gabriel. “I’ve taken one in the Gresham."""
"3076";"15";"114";"“To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate, “by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you’re not anxious about them?"""
"3077";"15";"115";"“0, for one night,"" said Mrs. Conroy. “Besides, Bessie will look after them."""
"3078";"15";"116";"“To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate again. “What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There’s that"
"3079";"15";"117";"Lily, I’m sure I don’t know what has come over her lately. She’s not the girl she was at all."""
"3080";"15";"118";"Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who"
"3081";"15";"119";"had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters."
"3082";"15";"120";"“Now, I ask you,"" she said almost testily, “where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?"""
"3083";"15";"121";"Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:"
"3084";"15";"122";"“Here’s Freddy."""
"3085";"15";"123";"At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The"
"3086";"15";"124";"drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered"
"3087";"15";"125";"into his ear:"
"3088";"15";"126";"“Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he’s all right, and don’t let him up if he’s screwed. I’m sure he’s"
"3089";"15";"127";"screwed. I’m sure he is."""
"3090";"15";"128";"Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he"
"3091";"15";"129";"recognised Freddy Malins’ laugh. He went down the stairs noisily."
"3092";"15";"130";"“It’s such a relief,"" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, “that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he’s"
"3093";"15";"131";"here.... Julia, there’s Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It"
"3094";"15";"132";"made lovely time."""
"3095";"15";"133";"A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:"
"3096";"15";"134";"“And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?"""
"3097";"15";"135";"“Julia,"" said Aunt Kate summarily, “and here’s Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss"
"3098";"15";"136";"Power."""
"3099";"15";"137";"“I’m the man for the ladies,"" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his"
"3100";"15";"138";"wrinkles. “You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is --"""
"3101";"15";"139";"He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into"
"3102";"15";"140";"the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the"
"3103";"15";"141";"caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and"
"3104";"15";"142";"bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets."
"3105";"15";"143";"At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters."
"3106";"15";"144";"Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they"
"3107";"15";"145";"said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to"
"3108";"15";"146";"move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him"
"3109";"15";"147";"respectfully while he took a trial sip."
"3110";"15";"148";"“God help me,"" he said, smiling, “it’s the doctor’s orders."""
"3111";"15";"149";"His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry,"
"3112";"15";"150";"swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:"
"3113";"15";"151";"“O, now, Mr. Browne, I’m sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind."""
"3114";"15";"152";"Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:"
"3115";"15";"153";"“Well, you see, I’m like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: ""˜Now, Mary Grimes, if I don’t take it,"
"3116";"15";"154";"make me take it, for I feel I want it.’"""
"3117";"15";"155";"His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young"
"3118";"15";"156";"ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane’s pupils, asked Miss Daly"
"3119";"15";"157";"what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two"
"3120";"15";"158";"young men who were more appreciative."
"3121";"15";"159";"A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:"
"3122";"15";"160";"“Quadrilles! Quadrilles!"""
"3123";"15";"161";"Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:"
"3124";"15";"162";"“Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!"""
"3125";"15";"163";"“O, here’s Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,"" said Mary Jane. “Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get"
"3126";"15";"164";"you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that’ll just do now."""
"3127";"15";"165";"“Three ladies, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate."
"3128";"15";"166";"The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly."
"3129";"15";"167";"“O, Miss Daly, you’re really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we’re so short of ladies"
"3130";"15";"168";"tonight."""
"3131";"15";"169";"“I don’t mind in the least, Miss Morkan."""
"3132";"15";"170";"“But I’ve a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor. I’ll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving"
"3133";"15";"171";"about him."""
"3134";"15";"172";"“Lovely voice, lovely voice!"" said Aunt Kate."
"3135";"15";"173";"As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had"
"3136";"15";"174";"hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something."
"3137";"15";"175";"“What is the matter, Julia?"" asked Aunt Kate anxiously. “Who is it?"""
"3138";"15";"176";"Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had"
"3139";"15";"177";"surprised her:"
"3140";"15";"178";"“It’s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him."""
"3141";"15";"179";"In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of"
"3142";"15";"180";"about forty, was of Gabriel’s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour"
"3143";"15";"181";"only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a"
"3144";"15";"182";"convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look"
"3145";"15";"183";"sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same"
"3146";"15";"184";"time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye."
"3147";"15";"185";"“Good-evening, Freddy,"" said Aunt Julia."
"3148";"15";"186";"Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in"
"3149";"15";"187";"his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and"
"3150";"15";"188";"began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel."
"3151";"15";"189";"“He’s not so bad, is he?"" said Aunt Kate to Gabriel."
"3152";"15";"190";"Gabriel’s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:"
"3153";"15";"191";"“O, no, hardly noticeable."""
"3154";"15";"192";"“Now, isn’t he a terrible fellow!"" she said. “And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year’s Eve. But come"
"3155";"15";"193";"on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room."""
"3156";"15";"194";"Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and"
"3157";"15";"195";"fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:"
"3158";"15";"196";"“Now, then, Teddy, I’m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up."""
"3159";"15";"197";"Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first"
"3160";"15";"198";"called Freddy Malins’ attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy"
"3161";"15";"199";"Malins’ left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress."
"3162";"15";"200";"Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins"
"3163";"15";"201";"exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting"
"3164";"15";"202";"down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left"
"3165";"15";"203";"eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him."
"3166";"15";"204";"Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the"
"3167";"15";"205";"hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any"
"3168";"15";"206";"melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the"
"3169";"15";"207";"refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes."
"3170";"15";"208";"The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from"
"3171";"15";"209";"it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the"
"3172";"15";"210";"page."
"3173";"15";"211";"Gabriel’s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall"
"3174";"15";"212";"above the piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two"
"3175";"15";"213";"murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl. Probably in the"
"3176";"15";"214";"school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday"
"3177";"15";"215";"present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes’ heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry"
"3178";"15";"216";"buttons. It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of"
"3179";"15";"217";"the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her photograph"
"3180";"15";"218";"stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who,"
"3181";"15";"219";"dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of"
"3182";"15";"220";"the dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel"
"3183";"15";"221";"himself had taken his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition"
"3184";"15";"222";"to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being"
"3185";"15";"223";"country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in"
"3186";"15";"224";"their house at Monkstown."
"3187";"15";"225";"He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales"
"3188";"15";"226";"after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of"
"3189";"15";"227";"octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her"
"3190";"15";"228";"music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had"
"3191";"15";"229";"gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped."
"3192";"15";"230";"Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady,"
"3193";"15";"231";"with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the"
"3194";"15";"232";"front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto."
"3195";"15";"233";"When they had taken their places she said abruptly:"
"3196";"15";"234";"“I have a crow to pluck with you."""
"3197";"15";"235";"“With me?"" said Gabriel."
"3198";"15";"236";"She nodded her head gravely."
"3199";"15";"237";"“What is it?"" asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner."
"3200";"15";"238";"“Who is G. C.?"" answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him."
"3201";"15";"239";"Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:"
"3202";"15";"240";"“O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?"""
"3203";"15";"241";"“Why should I be ashamed of myself?"" asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile."
"3204";"15";"242";"“Well, I’m ashamed of you,"" said Miss Ivors frankly. “To say you’d write for a paper like that. I didn’t think you were a"
"3205";"15";"243";"West Briton."""
"3206";"15";"244";"A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel’s face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily"
"3207";"15";"245";"Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for"
"3208";"15";"246";"review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed"
"3209";"15";"247";"books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand"
"3210";"15";"248";"booksellers, to Hickey’s on Bachelor’s Walk, to Web’s or Massey’s on Aston’s Quay, or to O’Clohissey’s in the bystreet. He"
"3211";"15";"249";"did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many"
"3212";"15";"250";"years’ standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a"
"3213";"15";"251";"grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing"
"3214";"15";"252";"political in writing reviews of books."
"3215";"15";"253";"When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm"
"3216";"15";"254";"grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:"
"3217";"15";"255";"“Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now."""
"3218";"15";"256";"When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had"
"3219";"15";"257";"shown her his review of Browning’s poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely."
"3220";"15";"258";"Then she said suddenly:"
"3221";"15";"259";"“O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We’re going to stay there a whole month. It"
"3222";"15";"260";"will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It"
"3223";"15";"261";"would be splendid for Gretta too if she’d come. She’s from Connacht, isn’t she?"""
"3224";"15";"262";"“Her people are,"" said Gabriel shortly."
"3225";"15";"263";"“But you will come, won’t you?"" said Miss Ivors, laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm."
"3226";"15";"264";"“The fact is,"" said Gabriel, “I have just arranged to go --"""
"3227";"15";"265";"“Go where?"" asked Miss Ivors."
"3228";"15";"266";"“Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so --"""
"3229";"15";"267";"“But where?"" asked Miss Ivors."
"3230";"15";"268";"“Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,"" said Gabriel awkwardly."
"3231";"15";"269";"“And why do you go to France and Belgium,"" said Miss Ivors, “instead of visiting your own land?"""
"3232";"15";"270";"“Well,"" said Gabriel, “it’s partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change."""
"3233";"15";"271";"“And haven’t you your own language to keep in touch with - Irish?"" asked Miss Ivors."
"3234";"15";"272";"“Well,"" said Gabriel, “if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language."""
"3235";"15";"273";"Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross - examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to"
"3236";"15";"274";"keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead."
"3237";"15";"275";"“And haven’t you your own land to visit,"" continued Miss Ivors, “that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own"
"3238";"15";"276";"country?"""
"3239";"15";"277";"“0, to tell you the truth,"" retorted Gabriel suddenly, “I’m sick of my own country, sick of it!"""
"3240";"15";"278";"“Why?"" asked Miss Ivors."
"3241";"15";"279";"Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him."
"3242";"15";"280";"“Why?"" repeated Miss Ivors."
"3243";"15";"281";"They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:"
"3244";"15";"282";"“Of course, you’ve no answer."""
"3245";"15";"283";"Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a"
"3246";"15";"284";"sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She"
"3247";"15";"285";"looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start"
"3248";"15";"286";"again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:"
"3249";"15";"287";"“West Briton!"""
"3250";"15";"288";"When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins’ mother was sitting. She"
"3251";"15";"289";"was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son’s and she stuttered slightly. She had"
"3252";"15";"290";"been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She"
"3253";"15";"291";"lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had"
"3254";"15";"292";"a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter"
"3255";"15";"293";"kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind"
"3256";"15";"294";"all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast"
"3257";"15";"295";"but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a"
"3258";"15";"296";"West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him"
"3259";"15";"297";"with her rabbit’s eyes."
"3260";"15";"298";"He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:"
"3261";"15";"299";"“Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won’t you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I’ll do the"
"3262";"15";"300";"pudding."""
"3263";"15";"301";"“All right,"" said Gabriel."
"3264";"15";"302";"“She’s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we’ll have the table to ourselves."""
"3265";"15";"303";"“Were you dancing?"" asked Gabriel."
"3266";"15";"304";"“Of course I was. Didn’t you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?"""
"3267";"15";"305";"“No row. Why? Did she say so?"""
"3268";"15";"306";"“Something like that. I’m trying to get that Mr. D’Arcy to sing. He’s full of conceit, I think."""
"3269";"15";"307";"“There was no row,"" said Gabriel moodily, “only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I"
"3270";"15";"308";"wouldn’t."""
"3271";"15";"309";"His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump."
"3272";"15";"310";"“O, do go, Gabriel,"" she cried. “I’d love to see Galway again."""
"3273";"15";"311";"“You can go if you like,"" said Gabriel coldly."
"3274";"15";"312";"She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:"
"3275";"15";"313";"“There’s a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins."""
"3276";"15";"314";"While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell"
"3277";"15";"315";"Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the"
"3278";"15";"316";"lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man"
"3279";"15";"317";"in the hotel cooked it for their dinner."
"3280";"15";"318";"Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about"
"3281";"15";"319";"the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and"
"3282";"15";"320";"retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and"
"3283";"15";"321";"knives. Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups."
"3284";"15";"322";"Gabriel’s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be"
"3285";"15";"323";"to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees"
"3286";"15";"324";"and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than at the"
"3287";"15";"325";"supper-table!"
"3288";"15";"326";"He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from"
"3289";"15";"327";"Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: “One feels that one is listening to a thought -"
"3290";"15";"328";"tormented music."" Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her"
"3291";"15";"329";"propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be"
"3292";"15";"330";"at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see"
"3293";"15";"331";"him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia:"
"3294";"15";"332";"“Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it"
"3295";"15";"333";"had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation"
"3296";"15";"334";"that is growing up around us seems to me to lack."" Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts"
"3297";"15";"335";"were only two ignorant old women?"
"3298";"15";"336";"A murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who"
"3299";"15";"337";"leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano"
"3300";"15";"338";"and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice"
"3301";"15";"339";"fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia’s - Arrayed"
"3302";"15";"340";"for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though"
"3303";"15";"341";"she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the"
"3304";"15";"342";"singer’s face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others"
"3305";"15";"343";"at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little"
"3306";"15";"344";"colour struggled into Aunt Julia’s face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had"
"3307";"15";"345";"her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still"
"3308";"15";"346";"applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in"
"3309";"15";"347";"acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand"
"3310";"15";"348";"he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for"
"3311";"15";"349";"him."
"3312";"15";"350";"“I was just telling my mother,"" he said, “I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as"
"3313";"15";"351";"it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That’s the truth. Upon my word and honour that’s the truth. I never heard"
"3314";"15";"352";"your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never."""
"3315";"15";"353";"Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne"
"3316";"15";"354";"extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to"
"3317";"15";"355";"an audience:"
"3318";"15";"356";"“Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!"""
"3319";"15";"357";"He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:"
"3320";"15";"358";"“Well, Browne, if you’re serious you might make a worse discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well"
"3321";"15";"359";"as long as I am coming here. And that’s the honest truth."""
"3322";"15";"360";"“Neither did I,"" said Mr. Browne. “I think her voice has greatly improved."""
"3323";"15";"361";"Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:"
"3324";"15";"362";"“Thirty years ago I hadn’t a bad voice as voices go."""
"3325";"15";"363";"“I often told Julia,"" said Aunt Kate emphatically, “that she was simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be"
"3326";"15";"364";"said by me."""
"3327";"15";"365";"She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of"
"3328";"15";"366";"her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face."
"3329";"15";"367";"“No,"" continued Aunt Kate, “she wouldn’t be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and"
"3330";"15";"368";"day. Six o’clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?"""
"3331";"15";"369";"“Well, isn’t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?"" asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling."
"3332";"15";"370";"Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:"
"3333";"15";"371";"“I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it’s not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women"
"3334";"15";"372";"out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose"
"3335";"15";"373";"it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it’s not just, Mary Jane, and it’s not right."""
"3336";"15";"374";"She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with"
"3337";"15";"375";"her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:"
"3338";"15";"376";"“Now, Aunt Kate, you’re giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion."""
"3339";"15";"377";"Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:"
"3340";"15";"378";"“O, I don’t question the pope’s being right. I’m only a stupid old woman and I wouldn’t presume to do such a thing. But"
"3341";"15";"379";"there’s such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia’s place I’d tell that Father Healey"
"3342";"15";"380";"straight up to his face..."""
"3343";"15";"381";"“And besides, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane, “we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very"
"3344";"15";"382";"quarrelsome."""
"3345";"15";"383";"“And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,"" added Mr. Browne."
"3346";"15";"384";"“So that we had better go to supper,"" said Mary Jane, “and finish the discussion afterwards."""
"3347";"15";"385";"On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for"
"3348";"15";"386";"supper. But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least"
"3349";"15";"387";"hungry and she had already overstayed her time."
"3350";"15";"388";"“But only for ten minutes, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy. “That won’t delay you."""
"3351";"15";"389";"“To take a pick itself,"" said Mary Jane, “after all your dancing."""
"3352";"15";"390";"“I really couldn’t,"" said Miss Ivors."
"3353";"15";"391";"“I am afraid you didn’t enjoy yourself at all,"" said Mary Jane hopelessly."
"3354";"15";"392";"“Ever so much, I assure you,"" said Miss Ivors, “but you really must let me run off now."""
"3355";"15";"393";"“But how can you get home?"" asked Mrs. Conroy."
"3356";"15";"394";"“O, it’s only two steps up the quay."""
"3357";"15";"395";"Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:"
"3358";"15";"396";"“If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I’ll see you home if you are really obliged to go."""
"3359";"15";"397";"But Miss Ivors broke away from them."
"3360";"15";"398";"“I won’t hear of it,"" she cried. “For goodness’ sake go in to your suppers and don’t mind me. I’m quite well able to take"
"3361";"15";"399";"care of myself."""
"3362";"15";"400";"“Well, you’re the comical girl, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy frankly."
"3363";"15";"401";"“Beannacht libh,"" cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase."
"3364";"15";"402";"Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen"
"3365";"15";"403";"for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour:"
"3366";"15";"404";"she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase."
"3367";"15";"405";"At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair."
"3368";"15";"406";"“Where is Gabriel?"" she cried. “Where on earth is Gabriel? There’s everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to"
"3369";"15";"407";"carve the goose!"""
"3370";"15";"408";"“Here I am, Aunt Kate!"" cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, “ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary."""
"3371";"15";"409";"A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of"
"3372";"15";"410";"parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin"
"3373";"15";"411";"and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters"
"3374";"15";"412";"of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a"
"3375";"15";"413";"stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid"
"3376";"15";"414";"rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in"
"3377";"15";"415";"gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as"
"3378";"15";"416";"sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut"
"3379";"15";"417";"glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in"
"3380";"15";"418";"waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their"
"3381";"15";"419";"uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green"
"3382";"15";"420";"sashes."
"3383";"15";"421";"Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork"
"3384";"15";"422";"firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself"
"3385";"15";"423";"at the head of a well-laden table."
"3386";"15";"424";"“Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?"" he asked. “A wing or a slice of the breast?"""
"3387";"15";"425";"“Just a small slice of the breast."""
"3388";"15";"426";"“Miss Higgins, what for you?"""
"3389";"15";"427";"“O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy."""
"3390";"15";"428";"While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest"
"3391";"15";"429";"with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane’s idea and she had also suggested apple"
"3392";"15";"430";"sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for"
"3393";"15";"431";"her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt"
"3394";"15";"432";"Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of"
"3395";"15";"433";"minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders,"
"3396";"15";"434";"of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the"
"3397";"15";"435";"first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for"
"3398";"15";"436";"he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still"
"3399";"15";"437";"toddling round the table, walking on each other’s heels, getting in each other’s way and giving each other unheeded orders."
"3400";"15";"438";"Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that,"
"3401";"15";"439";"at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter."
"3402";"15";"440";"When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:"
"3403";"15";"441";"“Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak."""
"3404";"15";"442";"A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved"
"3405";"15";"443";"for him."
"3406";"15";"444";"“Very well,"" said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, “kindly forget my existence, ladies and"
"3407";"15";"445";"gentlemen, for a few minutes."""
"3408";"15";"446";"He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily’s removal of the plates. The"
"3409";"15";"447";"subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor, a dark -"
"3410";"15";"448";"complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong"
"3411";"15";"449";"thought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second"
"3412";"15";"450";"part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard."
"3413";"15";"451";"“Have you heard him?"" he asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy across the table."
"3414";"15";"452";"“No,"" answered Mr. Bartell D’Arcy carelessly."
"3415";"15";"453";"“Because,"" Freddy Malins explained, “now I’d be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice."""
"3416";"15";"454";"“It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,"" said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table."
"3417";"15";"455";"“And why couldn’t he have a voice too?"" asked Freddy Malins sharply. “Is it because he’s only a black?"""
"3418";"15";"456";"Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a"
"3419";"15";"457";"pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go"
"3420";"15";"458";"back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin - Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the"
"3421";"15";"459";"great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard"
"3422";"15";"460";"in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an"
"3423";"15";"461";"Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery"
"3424";"15";"462";"boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her"
"3425";"15";"463";"themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia"
"3426";"15";"464";"Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why."
"3427";"15";"465";"“Oh, well,"" said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, “I presume there are as good singers today as there were then."""
"3428";"15";"466";"“Where are they?"" asked Mr. Browne defiantly."
"3429";"15";"467";"“In London, Paris, Milan,"" said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy warmly. “I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not"
"3430";"15";"468";"better than any of the men you have mentioned."""
"3431";"15";"469";"“Maybe so,"" said Mr. Browne. “But I may tell you I doubt it strongly."""
"3432";"15";"470";"“O, I’d give anything to hear Caruso sing,"" said Mary Jane."
"3433";"15";"471";"“For me,"" said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, “there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose"
"3434";"15";"472";"none of you ever heard of him."""
"3435";"15";"473";"“Who was he, Miss Morkan?"" asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy politely."
"3436";"15";"474";"“His name,"" said Aunt Kate, “was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor"
"3437";"15";"475";"voice that was ever put into a man’s throat."""
"3438";"15";"476";"“Strange,"" said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy. “I never even heard of him."""
"3439";"15";"477";"“Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,"" said Mr. Browne. “I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he’s too far back for"
"3440";"15";"478";"me."""
"3441";"15";"479";"“A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,"" said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm."
"3442";"15";"480";"Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again."
"3443";"15";"481";"Gabriel’s wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by"
"3444";"15";"482";"Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia’s"
"3445";"15";"483";"making and she received praises for it from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown enough."
"3446";"15";"484";"“Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,"" said Mr. Browne, “that I’m brown enough for you because, you know, I’m all brown."""
"3447";"15";"485";"All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets"
"3448";"15";"486";"the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told"
"3449";"15";"487";"that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor’s care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all"
"3450";"15";"488";"through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount"
"3451";"15";"489";"Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from"
"3452";"15";"490";"their guests."
"3453";"15";"491";"“And do you mean to say,"" asked Mr. Browne incredulously, “that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a"
"3454";"15";"492";"hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?"""
"3455";"15";"493";"“O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave."" said Mary Jane."
"3456";"15";"494";"“I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,"" said Mr. Browne candidly."
"3457";"15";"495";"He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked"
"3458";"15";"496";"what they did it for."
"3459";"15";"497";"“That’s the rule of the order,"" said Aunt Kate firmly."
"3460";"15";"498";"“Yes, but why?"" asked Mr. Browne."
"3461";"15";"499";"Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained"
"3462";"15";"500";"to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside"
"3463";"15";"501";"world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:"
"3464";"15";"502";"“I like that idea very much but wouldn’t a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?"""
"3465";"15";"503";"“The coffin,"" said Mary Jane, “is to remind them of their last end."""
"3466";"15";"504";"As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard"
"3467";"15";"505";"saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:"
"3468";"15";"506";"“They are very good men, the monks, very pious men."""
"3469";"15";"507";"The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and"
"3470";"15";"508";"Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr. Bartell D’Arcy refused to take either but one"
"3471";"15";"509";"of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the"
"3472";"15";"510";"last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by"
"3473";"15";"511";"unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a"
"3474";"15";"512";"few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair."
"3475";"15";"513";"The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on"
"3476";"15";"514";"the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier."
"3477";"15";"515";"The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door. People, perhaps,"
"3478";"15";"516";"were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air"
"3479";"15";"517";"was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a"
"3480";"15";"518";"gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres."
"3481";"15";"519";"He began:"
"3482";"15";"520";"“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"3483";"15";"521";"“It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid"
"3484";"15";"522";"my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate."""
"3485";"15";"523";"“No, no!"" said Mr. Browne."
"3486";"15";"524";"“But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a"
"3487";"15";"525";"few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion."
"3488";"15";"526";"“Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this"
"3489";"15";"527";"hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the recipients - or perhaps, I had better say, the victims - of"
"3490";"15";"528";"the hospitality of certain good ladies."""
"3491";"15";"529";"He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane"
"3492";"15";"530";"who all turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:"
"3493";"15";"531";"“I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which"
"3494";"15";"532";"it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and"
"3495";"15";"533";"I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a"
"3496";"15";"534";"failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust"
"3497";"15";"535";"will long be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies"
"3498";"15";"536";"aforesaid - and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come - the tradition of genuine"
"3499";"15";"537";"warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down"
"3500";"15";"538";"to our descendants, is still alive among us."""
"3501";"15";"539";"A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through Gabriel’s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she"
"3502";"15";"540";"had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:"
"3503";"15";"541";"“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"3504";"15";"542";"“A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and"
"3505";"15";"543";"enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we"
"3506";"15";"544";"are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new"
"3507";"15";"545";"generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour"
"3508";"15";"546";"which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I"
"3509";"15";"547";"must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days:"
"3510";"15";"548";"and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with"
"3511";"15";"549";"pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not"
"3512";"15";"550";"willingly let die."""
"3513";"15";"551";"“Hear, hear!"" said Mr. Browne loudly."
"3514";"15";"552";"“But yet,"" continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, “there are always in gatherings such as this"
"3515";"15";"553";"sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here"
"3516";"15";"554";"tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not"
"3517";"15";"555";"find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which"
"3518";"15";"556";"claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours."
"3519";"15";"557";"“Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are"
"3520";"15";"558";"gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the"
"3521";"15";"559";"spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of"
"3522";"15";"560";"- what shall I call them? - the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world."""
"3523";"15";"561";"The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to"
"3524";"15";"562";"tell her what Gabriel had said."
"3525";"15";"563";"“He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,"" said Mary Jane."
"3526";"15";"564";"Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:"
"3527";"15";"565";"“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"3528";"15";"566";"“I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between"
"3529";"15";"567";"them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our"
"3530";"15";"568";"chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who"
"3531";"15";"569";"seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or,"
"3532";"15";"570";"last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I"
"3533";"15";"571";"confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize."""
"3534";"15";"572";"Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia’s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt"
"3535";"15";"573";"Kate’s eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a"
"3536";"15";"574";"glass expectantly, and said loudly:"
"3537";"15";"575";"“Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may"
"3538";"15";"576";"they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour"
"3539";"15";"577";"and affection which they hold in our hearts."""
"3540";"15";"578";"All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as"
"3541";"15";"579";"leader:"
"3542";"15";"580";"For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can"
"3543";"15";"581";"deny."
"3544";"15";"582";"Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his"
"3545";"15";"583";"pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:"
"3546";"15";"584";"Unless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie,"
"3547";"15";"585";"Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:"
"3548";"15";"586";"For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can"
"3549";"15";"587";"deny."
"3550";"15";"588";"The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed"
"3551";"15";"589";"time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high."
"3552";"15";"590";"The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:"
"3553";"15";"591";"“Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold."""
"3554";"15";"592";"“Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane."
"3555";"15";"593";"“Browne is everywhere,"" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice."
"3556";"15";"594";"Mary Jane laughed at her tone."
"3557";"15";"595";"“Really,"" she said archly, “he is very attentive."""
"3558";"15";"596";"“He has been laid on here like the gas,"" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, “all during the Christmas."""
"3559";"15";"597";"She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:"
"3560";"15";"598";"“But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn’t hear me."""
"3561";"15";"599";"At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break."
"3562";"15";"600";"He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He"
"3563";"15";"601";"pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in."
"3564";"15";"602";"“Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,"" he said."
"3565";"15";"603";"Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall,"
"3566";"15";"604";"said:"
"3567";"15";"605";"“Gretta not down yet?"""
"3568";"15";"606";"“She’s getting on her things, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate."
"3569";"15";"607";"“Who’s playing up there?"" asked Gabriel."
"3570";"15";"608";"“Nobody. They’re all gone."""
"3571";"15";"609";"“O no, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane. “Bartell D’Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan aren’t gone yet."""
"3572";"15";"610";"“Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,"" said Gabriel."
"3573";"15";"611";"Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:"
"3574";"15";"612";"“It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn’t like to face your journey home at"
"3575";"15";"613";"this hour."""
"3576";"15";"614";"“I’d like nothing better this minute,"" said Mr. Browne stoutly, “than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive"
"3577";"15";"615";"with a good spanking goer between the shafts."""
"3578";"15";"616";"“We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,"" said Aunt Julia sadly."
"3579";"15";"617";"“The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,"" said Mary Jane, laughing."
"3580";"15";"618";"Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too."
"3581";"15";"619";"“Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?"" asked Mr. Browne."
"3582";"15";"620";"“The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,"" explained Gabriel, “commonly known in his later years as"
"3583";"15";"621";"the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler."""
"3584";"15";"622";"“O, now, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, laughing, “he had a starch mill."""
"3585";"15";"623";"“Well, glue or starch,"" said Gabriel, “the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in"
"3586";"15";"624";"the old gentleman’s mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very well; but now comes the"
"3587";"15";"625";"tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he’d like to drive out with the quality to a military"
"3588";"15";"626";"review in the park."""
"3589";"15";"627";"“The Lord have mercy on his soul,"" said Aunt Kate compassionately."
"3590";"15";"628";"“Amen,"" said Gabriel. “So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very"
"3591";"15";"629";"best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think."""
"3592";"15";"630";"Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel’s manner and Aunt Kate said:"
"3593";"15";"631";"“O, now, Gabriel, he didn’t live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was there."""
"3594";"15";"632";"“Out from the mansion of his forefathers,"" continued Gabriel, “he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully"
"3595";"15";"633";"until Johnny came in sight of King Billy’s statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether"
"3596";"15";"634";"he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue."""
"3597";"15";"635";"Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others."
"3598";"15";"636";"“Round and round he went,"" said Gabriel, “and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly"
"3599";"15";"637";"indignant. ""˜Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can’t understand the horse!"""
"3600";"15";"638";"The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel’s imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall"
"3601";"15";"639";"door. Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders"
"3602";"15";"640";"humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions."
"3603";"15";"641";"“I could only get one cab,"" he said."
"3604";"15";"642";"“O, we’ll find another along the quay,"" said Gabriel."
"3605";"15";"643";"“Yes,"" said Aunt Kate. “Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught."""
"3606";"15";"644";"Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab."
"3607";"15";"645";"Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At"
"3608";"15";"646";"last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused talk,"
"3609";"15";"647";"and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The"
"3610";"15";"648";"confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head"
"3611";"15";"649";"out through a window of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt"
"3612";"15";"650";"Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of"
"3613";"15";"651";"laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to"
"3614";"15";"652";"the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the"
"3615";"15";"653";"bewildered cabman above the din of everybody’s laughter:"
"3616";"15";"654";"“Do you know Trinity College?"""
"3617";"15";"655";"“Yes, sir,"" said the cabman."
"3618";"15";"656";"“Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,"" said Mr. Browne, “and then we’ll tell you where to go. You"
"3619";"15";"657";"understand now?"""
"3620";"15";"658";"“Yes, sir,"" said the cabman."
"3621";"15";"659";"“Make like a bird for Trinity College."""
"3622";"15";"660";"“Right, sir,"" said the cabman."
"3623";"15";"661";"The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus."
"3624";"15";"662";"Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was"
"3625";"15";"663";"standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta"
"3626";"15";"664";"and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning on the"
"3627";"15";"665";"banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could"
"3628";"15";"666";"hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a"
"3629";"15";"667";"man’s voice singing."
"3630";"15";"668";"He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife."
"3631";"15";"669";"There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing"
"3632";"15";"670";"on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that"
"3633";"15";"671";"attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt"
"3634";"15";"672";"would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter."
"3635";"15";"673";"The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing."
"3636";"15";"674";"“Well, isn’t Freddy terrible?"" said Mary Jane. “He’s really terrible."""
"3637";"15";"675";"Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the"
"3638";"15";"676";"voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in"
"3639";"15";"677";"the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by"
"3640";"15";"678";"distance and by the singer’s hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:"
"3641";"15";"679";"O, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My babe lies cold..."
"3642";"15";"680";"“O,"" exclaimed Mary Jane. “It’s Bartell D’Arcy singing and he wouldn’t sing all the night. O, I’ll get him to sing a song"
"3643";"15";"681";"before he goes."""
"3644";"15";"682";"“O, do, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate."
"3645";"15";"683";"Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano"
"3646";"15";"684";"was closed abruptly."
"3647";"15";"685";"“O, what a pity!"" she cried. “Is he coming down, Gretta?"""
"3648";"15";"686";"Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D’Arcy and"
"3649";"15";"687";"Miss O’Callaghan."
"3650";"15";"688";"“O, Mr. D’Arcy,"" cried Mary Jane, “it’s downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures"
"3651";"15";"689";"listening to you."""
"3652";"15";"690";"“I have been at him all the evening,"" said Miss O’Callaghan, “and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold"
"3653";"15";"691";"and couldn’t sing."""
"3654";"15";"692";"“O, Mr. D’Arcy,"" said Aunt Kate, “now that was a great fib to tell."""
"3655";"15";"693";"“Can’t you see that I’m as hoarse as a crow?"" said Mr. D’Arcy roughly."
"3656";"15";"694";"He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing"
"3657";"15";"695";"to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D’Arcy stood swathing his neck"
"3658";"15";"696";"carefully and frowning."
"3659";"15";"697";"“It’s the weather,"" said Aunt Julia, after a pause."
"3660";"15";"698";"“Yes, everybody has colds,"" said Aunt Kate readily, “everybody."""
"3661";"15";"699";"“They say,"" said Mary Jane, “we haven’t had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that"
"3662";"15";"700";"the snow is general all over Ireland."""
"3663";"15";"701";"“I love the look of snow,"" said Aunt Julia sadly."
"3664";"15";"702";"“So do I,"" said Miss O’Callaghan. “I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the"
"3665";"15";"703";"ground."""
"3666";"15";"704";"“But poor Mr. D’Arcy doesn’t like the snow,"" said Aunt Kate, smiling."
"3667";"15";"705";"Mr. D’Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold."
"3668";"15";"706";"Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air."
"3669";"15";"707";"Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the"
"3670";"15";"708";"flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in"
"3671";"15";"709";"the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her. At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was"
"3672";"15";"710";"colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart."
"3673";"15";"711";"“Mr. D’Arcy,"" she said, “what is the name of that song you were singing?"""
"3674";"15";"712";"“It’s called The Lass of Aughrim,"" said Mr. D’Arcy, “but I couldn’t remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?"""
"3675";"15";"713";"“The Lass of Aughrim,"" she repeated. “I couldn’t think of the name."""
"3676";"15";"714";"“It’s a very nice air,"" said Mary Jane. “I’m sorry you were not in voice tonight."""
"3677";"15";"715";"“Now, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate, “don’t annoy Mr. D’Arcy. I won’t have him annoyed."""
"3678";"15";"716";"Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:"
"3679";"15";"717";"“Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening."""
"3680";"15";"718";"“Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!"""
"3681";"15";"719";"“Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia."""
"3682";"15";"720";"“O, good-night, Gretta, I didn’t see you."""
"3683";"15";"721";"“Good-night, Mr. D’Arcy. Good-night, Miss O’Callaghan."""
"3684";"15";"722";"“Good-night, Miss Morkan."""
"3685";"15";"723";"“Good-night, again."""
"3686";"15";"724";"“Good-night, all. Safe home."""
"3687";"15";"725";"“Good-night. Good night."""
"3688";"15";"726";"The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be"
"3689";"15";"727";"descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and"
"3690";"15";"728";"on the area railings. The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four"
"3691";"15";"729";"Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky."
"3692";"15";"730";"She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands"
"3693";"15";"731";"holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel’s eyes were still bright with"
"3694";"15";"732";"happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender,"
"3695";"15";"733";"valorous."
"3696";"15";"734";"She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the"
"3697";"15";"735";"shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her"
"3698";"15";"736";"against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A"
"3699";"15";"737";"heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the"
"3700";"15";"738";"ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness. They were standing on"
"3701";"15";"739";"the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her in the cold,"
"3702";"15";"740";"looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in the"
"3703";"15";"741";"cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:"
"3704";"15";"742";"“Is the fire hot, sir?"""
"3705";"15";"743";"But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well. He might have answered rudely."
"3706";"15";"744";"A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender"
"3707";"15";"745";"fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his"
"3708";"15";"746";"memory. He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember"
"3709";"15";"747";"only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her"
"3710";"15";"748";"household cares had not quenched all their souls’ tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her then he had said:"
"3711";"15";"749";"“Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your"
"3712";"15";"750";"name?"""
"3713";"15";"751";"Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be"
"3714";"15";"752";"alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone"
"3715";"15";"753";"together. He would call her softly:"
"3716";"15";"754";"“Gretta!"""
"3717";"15";"755";"Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn"
"3718";"15";"756";"and look at him...."
"3719";"15";"757";"At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation."
"3720";"15";"758";"She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street."
"3721";"15";"759";"The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was"
"3722";"15";"760";"again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon."
"3723";"15";"761";"As the cab drove across O’Connell Bridge Miss O’Callaghan said:"
"3724";"15";"762";"“They say you never cross O’Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse."""
"3725";"15";"763";"“I see a white man this time,"" said Gabriel."
"3726";"15";"764";"“Where?"" asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy."
"3727";"15";"765";"Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand."
"3728";"15";"766";"“Good-night, Dan,"" he said gaily."
"3729";"15";"767";"When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D’Arcy’s protest, paid the driver."
"3730";"15";"768";"He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:"
"3731";"15";"769";"“A prosperous New Year to you, sir."""
"3732";"15";"770";"“The same to you,"" said Gabriel cordially."
"3733";"15";"771";"She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good"
"3734";"15";"772";"- night. She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and"
"3735";"15";"773";"happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling again of so many"
"3736";"15";"774";"memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover"
"3737";"15";"775";"of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped"
"3738";"15";"776";"from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new"
"3739";"15";"777";"adventure."
"3740";"15";"778";"An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the"
"3741";"15";"779";"stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the"
"3742";"15";"780";"stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly"
"3743";"15";"781";"about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize"
"3744";"15";"782";"her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter"
"3745";"15";"783";"halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could"
"3746";"15";"784";"hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs."
"3747";"15";"785";"The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked"
"3748";"15";"786";"at what hour they were to be called in the morning."
"3749";"15";"787";"“Eight,"" said Gabriel."
"3750";"15";"788";"The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short."
"3751";"15";"789";"“We don’t want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,"" he added, pointing to the candle, “you might"
"3752";"15";"790";"remove that handsome article, like a good man."""
"3753";"15";"791";"The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night"
"3754";"15";"792";"and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to."
"3755";"15";"793";"A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat"
"3756";"15";"794";"on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a"
"3757";"15";"795";"little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak"
"3758";"15";"796";"and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and"
"3759";"15";"797";"then said:"
"3760";"15";"798";"“Gretta!"""
"3761";"15";"799";"She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and"
"3762";"15";"800";"weary that the words would not pass Gabriel’s lips. No, it was not the moment yet."
"3763";"15";"801";"“You looked tired,"" he said."
"3764";"15";"802";"“I am a little,"" she answered."
"3765";"15";"803";"“You don’t feel ill or weak?"""
"3766";"15";"804";"“No, tired: that’s all."""
"3767";"15";"805";"She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about"
"3768";"15";"806";"to conquer him, he said abruptly:"
"3769";"15";"807";"“By the way, Gretta!"""
"3770";"15";"808";"“What is it?"""
"3771";"15";"809";"“You know that poor fellow Malins?"" he said quickly."
"3772";"15";"810";"“Yes. What about him?"""
"3773";"15";"811";"“Well, poor fellow, he’s a decent sort of chap, after all,"" continued Gabriel in a false voice. “He gave me back that"
"3774";"15";"812";"sovereign I lent him, and I didn’t expect it, really. It’s a pity he wouldn’t keep away from that Browne, because he’s not a"
"3775";"15";"813";"bad fellow, really."""
"3776";"15";"814";"He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed,"
"3777";"15";"815";"too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be"
"3778";"15";"816";"brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood."
"3779";"15";"817";"“When did you lend him the pound?"" she asked, after a pause."
"3780";"15";"818";"Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He"
"3781";"15";"819";"longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:"
"3782";"15";"820";"“O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street."""
"3783";"15";"821";"He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an"
"3784";"15";"822";"instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders,"
"3785";"15";"823";"she kissed him."
"3786";"15";"824";"“You are a very generous person, Gabriel,"" she said."
"3787";"15";"825";"Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and"
"3788";"15";"826";"began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was"
"3789";"15";"827";"brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts"
"3790";"15";"828";"had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come"
"3791";"15";"829";"upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident."
"3792";"15";"830";"He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him,"
"3793";"15";"831";"he said softly:"
"3794";"15";"832";"“Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?"""
"3795";"15";"833";"She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:"
"3796";"15";"834";"“Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?"""
"3797";"15";"835";"She did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:"
"3798";"15";"836";"“O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim."""
"3799";"15";"837";"She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood"
"3800";"15";"838";"stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight"
"3801";"15";"839";"of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it"
"3802";"15";"840";"in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:"
"3803";"15";"841";"“What about the song? Why does that make you cry?"""
"3804";"15";"842";"She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had"
"3805";"15";"843";"intended went into his voice."
"3806";"15";"844";"“Why, Gretta?"" he asked."
"3807";"15";"845";"“I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song."""
"3808";"15";"846";"“And who was the person long ago?"" asked Gabriel, smiling."
"3809";"15";"847";"“It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,"" she said."
"3810";"15";"848";"The smile passed away from Gabriel’s face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires"
"3811";"15";"849";"of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins."
"3812";"15";"850";"“Someone you were in love with?"" he asked ironically."
"3813";"15";"851";"“It was a young boy I used to know,"" she answered, “named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim."
"3814";"15";"852";"He was very delicate."""
"3815";"15";"853";"Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy."
"3816";"15";"854";"“I can see him so plainly,"" she said, after a moment. “Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in"
"3817";"15";"855";"them - an expression!"""
"3818";"15";"856";"“O, then, you are in love with him?"" said Gabriel."
"3819";"15";"857";"“I used to go out walking with him,"" she said, “when I was in Galway."""
"3820";"15";"858";"A thought flew across Gabriel’s mind."
"3821";"15";"859";"“Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?"" he said coldly."
"3822";"15";"860";"She looked at him and asked in surprise:"
"3823";"15";"861";"“What for?"""
"3824";"15";"862";"Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:"
"3825";"15";"863";"“How do I know? To see him, perhaps."""
"3826";"15";"864";"She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence."
"3827";"15";"865";"“He is dead,"" she said at length. “He died when he was only seventeen. Isn’t it a terrible thing to die so young as"
"3828";"15";"866";"that?"""
"3829";"15";"867";"“What was he?"" asked Gabriel, still ironically."
"3830";"15";"868";"“He was in the gasworks,"" she said."
"3831";"15";"869";"Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the"
"3832";"15";"870";"gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had"
"3833";"15";"871";"been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a"
"3834";"15";"872";"ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and"
"3835";"15";"873";"idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he"
"3836";"15";"874";"turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead."
"3837";"15";"875";"He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent."
"3838";"15";"876";"“I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,"" he said."
"3839";"15";"877";"“I was great with him at that time,"" she said."
"3840";"15";"878";"Her voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed,"
"3841";"15";"879";"caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:"
"3842";"15";"880";"“And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?"""
"3843";"15";"881";"“I think he died for me,"" she answered."
"3844";"15";"882";"A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and"
"3845";"15";"883";"vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it"
"3846";"15";"884";"with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell"
"3847";"15";"885";"him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had"
"3848";"15";"886";"caressed her first letter to him that spring morning."
"3849";"15";"887";"“It was in the winter,"" she said, “about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother’s and come"
"3850";"15";"888";"up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn’t be let out, and his people in"
"3851";"15";"889";"Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly."""
"3852";"15";"890";"She paused for a moment and sighed."
"3853";"15";"891";"“Poor fellow,"" she said. “He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you"
"3854";"15";"892";"know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good"
"3855";"15";"893";"voice, poor Michael Furey."""
"3856";"15";"894";"“Well; and then?"" asked Gabriel."
"3857";"15";"895";"“And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn’t be"
"3858";"15";"896";"let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be"
"3859";"15";"897";"better then."""
"3860";"15";"898";"She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:"
"3861";"15";"899";"“Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother’s house in Nuns’ Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up"
"3862";"15";"900";"against the window. The window was so wet I couldn’t see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the"
"3863";"15";"901";"garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering."""
"3864";"15";"902";"“And did you not tell him to go back?"" asked Gabriel."
"3865";"15";"903";"“I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to"
"3866";"15";"904";"live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree."""
"3867";"15";"905";"“And did he go home?"" asked Gabriel."
"3868";"15";"906";"“Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people"
"3869";"15";"907";"came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!"""
"3870";"15";"908";"She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt."
"3871";"15";"909";"Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and"
"3872";"15";"910";"walked quietly to the window."
"3873";"15";"911";"She was fast asleep."
"3874";"15";"912";"Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening"
"3875";"15";"913";"to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to"
"3876";"15";"914";"think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had"
"3877";"15";"915";"never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what"
"3878";"15";"916";"she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did"
"3879";"15";"917";"not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which"
"3880";"15";"918";"Michael Furey had braved death."
"3881";"15";"919";"Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A"
"3882";"15";"920";"petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its"
"3883";"15";"921";"side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt’s supper, from his"
"3884";"15";"922";"own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk"
"3885";"15";"923";"along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his"
"3886";"15";"924";"horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon,"
"3887";"15";"925";"perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be"
"3888";"15";"926";"drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He"
"3889";"15";"927";"would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes:"
"3890";"15";"928";"that would happen very soon."
"3891";"15";"929";"The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his"
"3892";"15";"930";"wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some"
"3893";"15";"931";"passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so"
"3894";"15";"932";"many years that image of her lover’s eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live."
"3895";"15";"933";"Generous tears filled Gabriel’s eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a"
"3896";"15";"934";"feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of"
"3897";"15";"935";"a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast"
"3898";"15";"936";"hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity"
"3899";"15";"937";"was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was"
"3900";"15";"938";"dissolving and dwindling."
"3901";"15";"939";"A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes,"
"3902";"15";"940";"silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes,"
"3903";"15";"941";"the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the"
"3904";"15";"942";"treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon"
"3905";"15";"943";"waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay"
"3906";"15";"944";"thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul"
"3907";"15";"945";"swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last"
"3908";"15";"946";"end, upon all the living and the dead."
