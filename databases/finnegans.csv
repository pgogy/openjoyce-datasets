came to pass that like cabbaging Cincinnatus the grand old gardener was saving daylight under his redwoodtree one sultry
sabbath afternoon, Hag Chivychas Eve, in prefall paradise peace by following his plough for rootles in the rere garden of
mobhouse, ye olde marine hotel, when royalty was announced by runner to have been pleased to have halted itself on the
highroad along which a leisureloving dogfox had cast followed, also at walking pace, by a lady pack of cocker spaniels. For
â€” getful of all save his vassal’s plain fealty to the ethnarch Humphrey or Harold stayed not to yoke or saddle but stumbled
out hotface as he was (his sweatful bandanna loose from his pocketcoat) hasting to the forecourts of his public in topee,
surcingle, solascarf and plaid, plus fours, puttees and bulldog boots ruddled cinnabar with 
flagrant marl, jingling his turnpike keys and bearing aloft amid the fixed pikes of the hunting party a high perch atop of
which a flowerpot was fixed earthside hoist with care. On his majesty, who was, or often feigned to be, noticeably
longsighted from green youth and had been meaning to inquire what, in effect, had caused yon causeway to be thus potholed,

lobstertrapping honest blunt Haromphreyld answered in no uncertain tones very similarly with a fear â€” less forehead: Naw,
yer maggers, aw war jist a cotchin on thon bluggy earwuggers. Our sailor king, who was draining a gugglet of obvious
adamale, gift both and gorban, upon this, ceasing to swallow, smiled most heartily beneath his walrus moustaches and
indulging that none too genial humour which William the Conk on the spindle side had inherited with the hereditary whitelock
and some shortfingeredness from his greataunt Sophy, turned towards two of his retinue of gallowglasses, Michael, etheling
lord of Leix and Offaly and the jubilee mayor of Drogheda, Elcock, (the two scatterguns being Michael M. Manning,
protosyndic of Waterford and an Italian excellency named Giubilei according to a later version cited by the learned
scholarch Canavan of Canmakenoise), in either case a triptychal religious family symbolising puritas of doctrina, business

Bear in mind, son of Hokmah, if so be you have me â€” theg in your midness, this man is mountain and unto changeth doth one
ascend. Heave we aside the fallacy, as punical as finikin, that it was not the king kingself but his inseparable sisters,
uncontrollable nighttalkers, Skertsiraizde with Donyahzade, who afterwards, when the robberers shot up the socialights, came
down into the world as amusers and were staged by Madame Sudlow as Rosa and Lily Miskinguette in the pantalime that two
pitts paythronosed, Miliodorus and Galathee. The great fact emerges that after that historic date all holographs so far
exhumed initialled by Haromphrey bear the sigla H.C.E. and while he was only and long and always good Dook Umphrey for the
hungerlean spalpeens of Lucalizod and Chimbers to his cronies it was equally certainly a pleasant turn of the populace which
gave him as sense of those normative letters the nickname Here Comes Everybody. An imposing everybody he always indeed
looked, constantly the same as and equal to himself and magnificently well worthy of any and all such universalisation,
every time he continually surveyed, amid vociferatings from in front of Accept these few nutties! and Take off that white
