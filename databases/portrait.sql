(4753, 5, 1393, '- And were you happier then? Cranly asked softly, happier than you are now, for instance?'),
(4754, 5, 1394, '- Often happy, Stephen said, and often unhappy. I was someone else then.'),
(4755, 5, 1395, '- How someone else? What do you mean by that statement?'),
(4756, 5, 1396, '- I mean, said Stephen, that I was not myself as I am now, as I had to become.'),

(4793, 5, 1433, 'He ceased and, as Stephen did not reply, remained silent. Then, as if giving utterance to the process of his own thought,'),

(4798, 5, 1438, 'ideas too. Every jackass going the roads thinks he has ideas.'),
(4799, 5, 1439, 'Stephen, who had been listening to the unspoken speech behind the words, said with assumed carelessness:'),

(4801, 5, 1441, '- Pascal was a pig, said Cranly.'),

(4810, 5, 1450, '- The first person to whom that idea occurred, Stephen answered, was Jesus himself.'),
(4811, 5, 1451, '- I mean, Cranly said, hardening in his speech, did the idea ever occur to you that he was himself a conscious hypocrite,'),
