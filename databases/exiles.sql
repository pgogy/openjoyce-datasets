(3, '1', '4', 'BEATRICE', 'Since morning.'),
(4, '1', '6', 'BEATRICE', 'O, no.  Did he practise the piano while I was away?'),
(5, '1', '8', 'BEATRICE', 'Rather wet, I think.'),
(6, '1', '10', 'BEATRICE', 'Is Mr Rowan in?'),
(7, '1', '14', 'RICHARD', 'Welcome.'),
(8, '1', '15', 'BEATRICE', 'Good afternoon, Mr Rowan. I did not want Brigid to disturb you.'),
(9, '1', '16', 'RICHARD', 'Disturb me? My goodness!'),

(11, '1', '18', 'RICHARD', 'Here.'),
(12, '1', '19', 'RICHARD', 'Letters?'),
(13, '1', '20', 'BRIGID', 'No, sir. Only them Italian newspapers.'),
(14, '1', '21', 'RICHARD', 'Leave them on my desk, will you?'),
(15, '1', '22', 'RICHARD', 'Please, sit down. Bertha will be back in a moment.'),
(16, '1', '23', 'RICHARD', 'I had begun to think you would never come back. It is twelve days since you were here.'),
(17, '1', '24', 'BEATRICE', 'I thought of that too. But I have come.'),
(18, '1', '25', 'RICHARD', 'Have you thought over what I told you when you were here last?'),
(19, '1', '26', 'BEATRICE', 'Very much.'),
(20, '1', '27', 'RICHARD', 'You must have known it before. Did you?  Do you blame me?'),
(21, '1', '28', 'BEATRICE', 'No.'),
(22, '1', '29', 'RICHARD', 'Do you think I have acted towards you-- badly? No? Or towards anyone?'),
(23, '1', '30', 'BEATRICE', 'I have asked myself that question.'),
(24, '1', '31', 'RICHARD', 'And the answer?'),
(25, '1', '32', 'BEATRICE', 'I could not answer it.'),
(26, '1', '33', 'RICHARD', 'If I were a painter and told you I had a book of sketches of you you would not think it so strange, would you?'),
(27, '1', '34', 'BEATRICE', 'It is not quite the same case, is it?'),
(28, '1', '35', 'RICHARD', 'Not quite. I told you also that I would not show you what I had written unless you asked to see it. Well?'),
(29, '1', '36', 'BEATRICE', 'I will not ask you.'),
(30, '1', '37', 'RICHARD', 'Would you like to see it?'),
(31, '1', '38', 'BEATRICE', 'Very much.'),
(32, '1', '39', 'RICHARD', 'Because it is about yourself?'),
(33, '1', '40', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes. But not only that.'),
(34, '1', '41', 'RICHARD', 'Because it is written by me? Yes? Even if what you would find there is sometimes cruel?'),
(35, '1', '42', 'BEATRICE', 'That is part of your mind, too.'),
(36, '1', '43', 'RICHARD', 'Then it is my mind that attracts you? Is that it?'),
(37, '1', '44', 'BEATRICE', 'Why do you think I come here?'),
(38, '1', '46', 'BEATRICE', 'No.'),
(39, '1', '47', 'RICHARD', 'Why, then?'),
(40, '1', '48', 'BEATRICE', 'Otherwise I could not see you.'),
(41, '1', '49', 'RICHARD', 'Otherwise you could not see me?'),
(42, '1', '50', 'BEATRICE', 'Mr Rowan, I must go.'),
(43, '1', '51', 'RICHARD', 'But you are running away. Remain. Tell me what your words mean. Are you afraid of me?'),
(44, '1', '52', 'BEATRICE', 'Afraid? No.'),
(45, '1', '53', 'RICHARD', 'Have you confidence in me? Do you feel that you know me?'),
(46, '1', '54', 'BEATRICE', 'It is hard to know anyone but oneself.'),
(47, '1', '55', 'RICHARD', 'Hard to know me? I sent you from Rome the chapters of my book as I wrote them; and letters for nine long years. Well, eight years.'),
(48, '1', '56', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes, it was nearly a year before your first letter came.'),
(49, '1', '57', 'RICHARD', 'It was answered at once by you. And from that on you have watched me in my struggle.  Tell me, Miss Justice, did you feel that what you read was written for your eyes? Or that you inspired me?'),
(50, '1', '58', 'BEATRICE', 'I need not answer that question.'),
(51, '1', '59', 'RICHARD', 'What then?'),
(52, '1', '60', 'BEATRICE', 'I cannot say it. You yourself must ask me, Mr Rowan.'),
(53, '1', '61', 'RICHARD', 'Then that I expressed in those chapters and letters, and in my character and life as well, something in your soul which you could not-- pride or scorn?'),
(54, '1', '62', 'BEATRICE', 'Could not?'),
(55, '1', '63', 'RICHARD', 'Could not because you dared not. Is that why?'),
(56, '1', '64', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes.'),
(57, '1', '65', 'RICHARD', 'On account of others or for want of courage-- which?'),
(58, '1', '66', 'BEATRICE', 'Courage.'),
(59, '1', '67', 'RICHARD', 'And so you have followed me with pride and scorn also in your heart?'),
(60, '1', '68', 'BEATRICE', 'And loneliness.'),
(61, '1', '69', 'RICHARD', 'Do you love him still?'),
(62, '1', '70', 'BEATRICE', 'I do not even know.'),
(63, '1', '71', 'RICHARD', 'It was that that made me so reserved with you-- then-- even though I felt your interest in me, even though I felt that I too was something in your life.'),
(64, '1', '72', 'BEATRICE', 'You were.'),
(65, '1', '73', 'RICHARD', 'Yet that separated me from you. I was a third person I felt. Your names were always spoken together, Robert and Beatrice, as long as I can remember. It seemed to me, to everyone...'),
(66, '1', '74', 'BEATRICE', 'We are first cousins. It is not strange that we were often together.'),
(67, '1', '75', 'RICHARD', 'He told me of your secret engagement with him. He had no secrets from me; I suppose you know that.'),
(68, '1', '76', 'BEATRICE', 'What happened-- between us-- is so long ago. I was a child.'),
(69, '1', '77', 'RICHARD', 'Over there. You plighted your troth, as they say, with a kiss. And you gave him your garter. Is it allowed to mention that?'),
(70, '1', '78', 'BEATRICE', 'If you think it worthy of mention.'),
(71, '1', '79', 'RICHARD', 'I think you have not forgotten it.  I do not understand it. I thought, too, that after I had gone... Did my going make you suffer?'),
(72, '1', '80', 'BEATRICE', 'I always knew you would go some day. I did not suffer; only I was changed.'),
(73, '1', '81', 'RICHARD', 'Towards him?'),
(74, '1', '82', 'BEATRICE', 'Everything was changed. His life, his mind, even, seemed to change after that.'),
(75, '1', '83', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. I saw that you had changed when I received your first letter after a year; after your illness, too. You even said so in your letter.'),
(76, '1', '84', 'BEATRICE', 'It brought me near to death. It made me see things differently.'),
(77, '1', '85', 'RICHARD', 'And so a coldness began between you, little by little. Is that it?'),
(78, '1', '86', 'BEATRICE', 'No. Not at once. I saw in him a pale reflection of you: then that too faded. Of what good is it to talk now?'),
(79, '1', '87', 'RICHARD', 'But what is this that seems to hang over you? It cannot be so tragic.'),
(80, '1', '88', 'BEATRICE', 'I am convalescent.'),
(81, '1', '89', 'RICHARD', 'Does nothing then in life give you peace? Surely it exists for you somewhere.'),
(82, '1', '90', 'BEATRICE', 'If there were convents in our religion perhaps there. At least, I think so at times.'),
(83, '1', '91', 'RICHARD', 'No, Miss Justice, not even there. You could not give yourself freely and wholly.'),
(84, '1', '92', 'BEATRICE', 'I would try.'),
(85, '1', '93', 'RICHARD', 'You would try, yes. You were drawn to him as your mind was drawn towards mine. You held back from him. From me, too, in a different way. You cannot give yourself freely and wholly.'),
(86, '1', '94', 'BEATRICE', 'It is a terribly hard thing to do, Mr Rowan-- to give oneself freely and wholly-- and be happy.'),
(87, '1', '95', 'RICHARD', 'But do you feel that happiness is the best, the highest that we can know?'),
(88, '1', '96', 'BEATRICE', 'I wish I could feel it.'),
(89, '1', '98', 'BEATRICE', 'Did she send for you before she died, Mr Rowan?'),
(90, '1', '99', 'RICHARD', 'Who?'),
(91, '1', '100', 'BEATRICE', 'Your mother.'),
(92, '1', '101', 'RICHARD', 'So that, too, was said of me here by my friends-- that she sent for me before she died and that I did not go?'),
(93, '1', '102', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes.'),
(94, '1', '103', 'RICHARD', 'She did not. She died alone, not having forgiven me, and fortified by the rites of holy church.'),
(95, '1', '104', 'BEATRICE', 'Mr Rowan, why did you speak to me in such a way?'),
(96, '1', '105', 'RICHARD', 'And what I suffer at this moment you will say is my punishment.'),
(97, '1', '106', 'BEATRICE', 'Did she write to you? I mean before...'),
(98, '1', '107', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. A letter of warning, bidding me break with the past, and remember her last words to me.'),
(99, '1', '108', 'BEATRICE', 'And does death not move you, Mr Rowan? It is an end. Everything else is so uncertain.'),
(100, '1', '109', 'RICHARD', 'While she lived she turned aside from me and from mine. That is certain.'),
(101, '1', '110', 'BEATRICE', 'From you and from...?'),
(102, '1', '111', 'RICHARD', 'From Bertha and from me and from our child. And so I waited for the end as you say; and it came.'),
(103, '1', '112', 'BEATRICE', 'O, no. Surely no.'),
(104, '1', '113', 'RICHARD', 'It fights against me still-- in here.'),
(105, '1', '114', 'BEATRICE', 'O, do not speak like that.'),
(106, '1', '115', 'RICHARD', 'She drove me away. On account of her I lived years in exile and poverty too, or near it. I never accepted the doles she sent me through the bank. I waited, too, not for her death but for some understanding of me, her own son, her own flesh and blood; that never came.'),
(107, '1', '116', 'BEATRICE', 'Not even after Archie...?'),
(108, '1', '117', 'RICHARD', 'In any case a remarkable woman.'),
(109, '1', '118', 'BEATRICE', 'At least you are free now.'),
(110, '1', '120', 'BEATRICE', 'They are both gone now, Mr Rowan. They both loved you, believe me. Their last thoughts were of you.'),
(111, '1', '121', 'RICHARD', 'He told my mother to give me a shilling. I kissed him and went. When I came home he was dead. Those were his last thoughts as far as I know.'),
(112, '1', '122', 'BEATRICE', 'The hardness of heart you prayed for...'),
(113, '1', '123', 'RICHARD', 'That is my last memory of him. Is there not something sweet and noble in it?'),
(114, '1', '124', 'BEATRICE', 'Mr Rowan, something is on your mind to make you speak like this. Something has changed you since you came back three months ago.'),
(115, '1', '125', 'RICHARD', 'He will help me, perhaps, my smiling handsome father.'),
(116, '1', '126', 'RICHARD', 'No, no. Not the smiler, Miss Justice. The old mother. It is her spirit I need. I am going.'),
(117, '1', '127', 'BEATRICE', 'Someone knocked. They have come back.'),
(118, '1', '128', 'RICHARD', 'No, Bertha has a key. It is he. At least, I am going, whoever it is.'),
(119, '1', '129', 'BEATRICE', 'He? Who?'),
(120, '1', '130', 'RICHARD', 'O, probably Robert. I am going out through the garden. I cannot see him now. Say I have gone to the post. Goodbye.'),
(121, '1', '131', 'BEATRICE', 'It is Robert you do not wish to see?'),
(122, '1', '132', 'RICHARD', 'For the moment, yes. This talk has upset me. Ask him to wait.'),
(123, '1', '133', 'BEATRICE', 'You will come back?'),
(124, '1', '134', 'RICHARD', 'Please God.'),
(125, '1', '135', 'ROBERT', 'My dearest coz. Brigid told me you were here. I had no notion. Did you send mother a telegram?'),
(126, '1', '136', 'BEATRICE', 'No.'),
(127, '1', '137', 'ROBERT', 'I am afraid they are not nice.'),
(128, '1', '138', 'BRIGID', 'O, they are lovely, sir. The mistress will be delighted with them.'),
(129, '1', '139', 'ROBERT', 'Is nobody in?'),
(130, '1', '141', 'ROBERT', 'How are you, Beatty? And how are all down in Youghal? As dull as ever?'),
(131, '1', '142', 'BEATRICE', 'They were well when I left.'),
(132, '1', '144', 'BEATRICE', 'Thank you, Robert. I am quite used to getting about alone.'),
(133, '1', '145', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, but I mean to say... O, well, you have arrived in your own characteristic way.  By Jove, Archie, too, is arriving in a characteristic way!'),
(134, '1', '146', 'BEATRICE', 'Goodness gracious, Archie! What is the matter?'),
(135, '1', '147', 'ARCHIE', 'Eh! I ran all the avenue.'),
(136, '1', '148', 'ROBERT', 'Good evening, Archie. Why did you run?'),
(137, '1', '149', 'ARCHIE', 'But you did not see me. But we saw you, mamma and I. She will be here in a minute. I ran.'),
(138, '1', '150', 'BEATRICE', 'And poor me!'),
(139, '1', '151', 'ARCHIE', 'Good evening, Miss Justice.'),
(140, '1', '152', 'BEATRICE', 'Were you disappointed that I did not come last Friday for the lesson?'),
(141, '1', '153', 'ARCHIE', 'No.'),
(142, '1', '154', 'BEATRICE', 'Glad?'),
(143, '1', '155', 'ARCHIE', 'But today it is too late.'),
(144, '1', '156', 'BEATRICE', 'A very short lesson?'),
(145, '1', '157', 'ARCHIE', 'Yes.'),
(146, '1', '158', 'BEATRICE', 'But now you must study, Archie.'),
(147, '1', '159', 'ROBERT', 'Were you at the bath?'),
(148, '1', '160', 'ARCHIE', 'Yes.'),
(149, '1', '161', 'ROBERT', 'Are you a good swimmer now?'),
(150, '1', '163', 'ROBERT', 'Splendidly. Like a stone.'),
(151, '1', '164', 'ARCHIE', 'Down that way?'),
(152, '1', '165', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, down; straight down. How do you say that over in Italy?'),
(153, '1', '166', 'ARCHIE', 'That?  Do you want to speak to my pappie?'),
(154, '1', '167', 'ROBERT', 'Yes. I came to see him.'),
(155, '1', '168', 'ARCHIE', 'I will tell him. He is in there, writing.'),
(156, '1', '169', 'BEATRICE', 'No; he is out. He is gone to the post with some letters.'),
(157, '1', '170', 'ROBERT', 'O, never mind. I will wait if he is only gone to the post.'),
(158, '1', '171', 'ARCHIE', 'But mamma is coming.  Here she is!'),
(159, '1', '172', 'BERTHA', 'Good evening, Miss Justice. We thought you were still down in Youghal.'),
(160, '1', '173', 'BEATRICE', 'Good evening, Mrs Rowan.'),
(161, '1', '174', 'BERTHA', 'Good evening, Mr Hand.'),
(162, '1', '176', 'BERTHA', 'Did you not come together?'),
(163, '1', '177', 'BEATRICE', 'No. I came first. Mr Rowan was going out. He said you would be back any moment.'),
(164, '1', '179', 'BEATRICE', 'I arrived only an hour and a half ago. I thought of sending a telegram but it seemed too tragic.'),
(165, '1', '180', 'BERTHA', 'Ah? Only now you arrived?'),
(166, '1', '181', 'ROBERT', 'I retire from public and private life. Her first cousin and a journalist, I know nothing of her movements.'),
(167, '1', '182', 'BEATRICE', 'My movements are not very interesting.'),
(168, '1', '188', 'BEATRICE', 'That I forgot. But we have the old piece.'),
(169, '1', '189', 'ROBERT', 'You little scamp. You want to get off the lesson.'),
(170, '1', '191', 'ARCHIE', 'I will, mamma.'),
(171, '1', '192', 'BEATRICE', 'No, please Mrs Rowan. Archie! I would really prefer...'),
(172, '1', '193', 'ROBERT', 'I suggest a compromise. Let it be a half-lesson.'),
(173, '1', '194', 'BERTHA', 'But she must be exhausted.'),
(174, '1', '195', 'BEATRICE', 'Not in the least. I was thinking of the lesson in the train.'),
(175, '1', '196', 'ROBERT', 'You see what it is to have a conscience, Mrs Rowan.'),
(176, '1', '197', 'ARCHIE', 'Of my lesson, Miss Justice?'),
(177, '1', '198', 'BEATRICE', 'It is ten days since I heard the sound of a piano.'),
(178, '1', '199', 'BERTHA', 'O, very well. If that is it...'),
(179, '1', '200', 'ROBERT', 'Shall I tell?'),
(180, '1', '201', 'BEATRICE', 'If you know.'),
(181, '1', '203', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes. I can hear it.'),
(182, '1', '204', 'ROBERT', 'So can I. The asthmatic voice of protestantism.'),
(183, '1', '205', 'BERTHA', 'Did you not enjoy yourself down there, Miss Justice?'),
(184, '1', '206', 'ROBERT', 'She did not, Mrs Rowan. She goes there on retreat, when the protestant strain in her prevails-- gloom, seriousness, righteousness.'),
(185, '1', '207', 'BEATRICE', 'I go to see my father.'),
(186, '1', '208', 'ROBERT', 'But she comes back here to my mother, you see. The piano influence is from our side of the house.'),
(187, '1', '210', 'ROBERT', 'Do, Beatty. That is what you want.'),
(188, '1', '211', 'BEATRICE', 'If Archie will come?'),
(189, '1', '212', 'ARCHIE', 'To listen.'),
(190, '1', '213', 'BEATRICE', 'And a little lesson, too. Very short.'),
(191, '1', '214', 'BERTHA', 'Well, afterwards you must stay to tea.'),
(192, '1', '215', 'BEATRICE', 'Come.'),
(193, '1', '216', 'BERTHA', 'You put this into my hand last night. What does it mean?'),
(194, '1', '217', 'ROBERT', 'Do you not know?'),
(195, '1', '218', 'BERTHA', 'What is the word?'),
(196, '1', '219', 'ROBERT', 'That I have a deep liking for you.'),
(197, '1', '220', 'ROBERT', 'I brought these for you. Will you take them from me?'),
(198, '1', '221', 'BERTHA', 'Why did you not dare to say it last night?'),
(199, '1', '222', 'ROBERT', 'I could not speak to you or follow you. There were too many people on the lawn. I wanted you to think over it and so I put it into your hand when you were going away.'),
(200, '1', '223', 'BERTHA', 'Now you have dared to say it.'),
(201, '1', '224', 'ROBERT', 'You passed. The avenue was dim with dusky light. I could see the dark green masses of the trees. And you passed beyond them. You were like the moon.'),
(202, '1', '225', 'BERTHA', 'Why like the moon?'),
(203, '1', '226', 'ROBERT', 'In that dress, with your slim body, walking with little even steps. I saw the moon passing in the dusk till you passed and left my sight.'),
(204, '1', '227', 'BERTHA', 'Did you think of me last night?'),
(205, '1', '228', 'ROBERT', 'I think of you always-- as something beautiful and distant-- the moon or some deep music.'),
(206, '1', '229', 'BERTHA', 'And last night which was I?'),
(207, '1', '230', 'ROBERT', 'I was awake half the night. I could hear your voice. I could see your face in the dark. Your eyes... I want to speak to you. Will you listen to me? May I speak?'),
(208, '1', '231', 'BERTHA', 'You may.'),
(209, '1', '232', 'ROBERT', 'Are you annoyed with me?'),
(210, '1', '233', 'BERTHA', 'No.'),
(211, '1', '234', 'ROBERT', 'I thought you were. You put away my poor flowers so quickly.'),
(212, '1', '235', 'BERTHA', 'Is this what you wish me to do with them?'),
(213, '1', '236', 'ROBERT', 'Why are you smiling? At my words?'),
(214, '1', '237', 'BERTHA', 'I am wondering if that is what you say-- to the others.'),
(215, '1', '238', 'ROBERT', 'What others?'),
(216, '1', '239', 'BERTHA', 'The other women. I hear you have so many admirers.'),
(217, '1', '240', 'ROBERT', 'And that is why you too...?'),
(218, '1', '242', 'ROBERT', 'Friends, yes.'),
(219, '1', '243', 'BERTHA', 'Do you speak to them in the same way?'),
(220, '1', '244', 'ROBERT', 'How can you ask me such a question? What kind of person do you think I am? Or why do you listen to me? Did you not like me to speak to you in that way?'),
(221, '1', '245', 'BERTHA', 'What you said was very kind.  Thank you for saying it-- and thinking it.'),
(222, '1', '246', 'ROBERT', 'Bertha!'),
(223, '1', '247', 'BERTHA', 'Yes?'),
(224, '1', '248', 'ROBERT', 'I have the right to call you by your name. From old times-- nine years ago. We were Bertha-- and Robert-- then. Can we not be so now, too?'),
(225, '1', '249', 'BERTHA', 'O yes. Why should we not?'),
(226, '1', '250', 'ROBERT', 'Bertha, you knew. From the very night you landed on Kingstown pier. It all came back to me then. And you knew it. You saw it.'),
(227, '1', '251', 'BERTHA', 'No. Not that night.'),
(228, '1', '252', 'ROBERT', 'When?'),
(229, '1', '253', 'BERTHA', 'The night we landed I felt very tired and dirty.  I did not see it in you that night.'),
(230, '1', '254', 'ROBERT', 'Tell me what did you see that night-- your very first impression.'),
(231, '1', '255', 'BERTHA', 'You were standing with your back to the gangway, talking to two ladies.'),
(232, '1', '256', 'ROBERT', 'To two plain middleaged ladies, yes.'),
(233, '1', '257', 'BERTHA', 'I recognized you at once. And I saw that you had got fat.'),
(234, '1', '258', 'ROBERT', 'And this poor fat Robert-- do you dislike him then so much? Do you disbelieve all he says?'),
(235, '1', '259', 'BERTHA', 'I think men speak like that to all women whom they like or admire. What do you want me to believe?'),
(236, '1', '260', 'ROBERT', 'All men, Bertha?'),
(237, '1', '261', 'BERTHA', 'I think so.'),
(238, '1', '262', 'ROBERT', 'I too?'),
(239, '1', '263', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, Robert. I think you too.'),
(240, '1', '264', 'ROBERT', 'All then-- without exception? Or with one exception?  Or is he too-- Richard too-- like us all-- in that at least? Or different?'),
(241, '1', '265', 'BERTHA', 'Different.'),
(242, '1', '266', 'ROBERT', 'Are you quite sure, Bertha?'),
(243, '1', '267', 'BERTHA', 'I have answered you.'),
(244, '1', '268', 'ROBERT', 'Bertha, may I kiss your hand? Let me. May I?'),
(245, '1', '269', 'BERTHA', 'If you wish.'),
(246, '1', '270', 'BERTHA', 'Did you hear the garden gate?'),
(247, '1', '271', 'ROBERT', 'No.'),
(248, '1', '272', 'ROBERT', 'Do not go away. You must never go away now. Your life is here. I came for that too today-- to speak to him-- to urge him to accept this position. He must. And you must persuade him to. You have a great influence over him.'),
(249, '1', '273', 'BERTHA', 'You want him to remain here.'),
(250, '1', '274', 'ROBERT', 'Yes.'),
(251, '1', '275', 'BERTHA', 'Why?'),
(252, '1', '276', 'ROBERT', 'For your sake because you are unhappy so far away. For his sake too because he should think of his future.'),
(253, '1', '277', 'BERTHA', 'Do you remember what he said when you spoke to him last night?'),
(254, '1', '278', 'ROBERT', 'About...?  about our daily bread. He said that to take care for the future is to destroy hope and love in the world.'),
(255, '1', '279', 'BERTHA', 'Do you not think he is strange?'),
(256, '1', '280', 'ROBERT', 'In that, yes.'),
(257, '1', '281', 'BERTHA', 'A little-- mad?'),
(258, '1', '282', 'ROBERT', 'No. He is not. Perhaps we are. Why, do you...?'),
(259, '1', '283', 'BERTHA', 'I ask you because you are intelligent.'),
(260, '1', '284', 'ROBERT', 'You must not go away. I will not let you.'),
(261, '1', '285', 'BERTHA', 'You?'),
(262, '1', '286', 'ROBERT', 'Those eyes must not go away.  May I kiss your eyes?'),
(263, '1', '287', 'BERTHA', 'Do so.'),
(264, '1', '288', 'ROBERT', 'Little Bertha!'),
(265, '1', '289', 'BERTHA', 'But I am not so little. Why do you call me little?'),
(266, '1', '290', 'ROBERT', 'Little Bertha! One embrace?  Look into my eyes again.'),
(267, '1', '291', 'BERTHA', 'I can see the little gold spots. So many you have.'),
(268, '1', '292', 'ROBERT', 'Your voice! Give me a kiss, a kiss with your mouth.'),
(269, '1', '293', 'BERTHA', 'Take it.'),
(270, '1', '294', 'ROBERT', 'I am afraid.  At last I hold you in my arms!'),
(271, '1', '295', 'BERTHA', 'And are you satisfied?'),
(272, '1', '296', 'ROBERT', 'Let me feel your lips touch mine.'),
(273, '1', '297', 'BERTHA', 'And then you will be satisfied?'),
(274, '1', '298', 'ROBERT', 'Your lips, Bertha!'),
(275, '1', '300', 'ROBERT', 'My life is finished-- over.'),
(276, '1', '302', 'ROBERT', 'Over, over. I want to end it and have done with it.'),
(277, '1', '303', 'BERTHA', 'You silly fellow!'),
(278, '1', '304', 'ROBERT', 'To end it all-- death. To fall from a great high cliff, down, right down into the sea.'),
(279, '1', '305', 'BERTHA', 'Please, Robert...'),
(280, '1', '306', 'ROBERT', 'Listening to music and in the arms of the woman I love-- the sea, music and death.'),
(281, '1', '307', 'BERTHA', 'The woman you love?'),
(282, '1', '308', 'ROBERT', 'I want to speak to you, Bertha-- alone-- not here. Will you come?'),
(283, '1', '309', 'BERTHA', 'I too want to speak to you.'),
(284, '1', '310', 'ROBERT', 'I will speak to you; tell you all; then. I will kiss you, then, long long kisses-- when you come to me-- long long sweet kisses.'),
(285, '1', '311', 'BERTHA', 'Where?'),
(286, '1', '312', 'ROBERT', 'Your eyes. Your lips. All your divine body.'),
(287, '1', '313', 'BERTHA', 'I meant where do you wish me to come.'),
(288, '1', '315', 'BERTHA', 'When?'),
(289, '1', '316', 'ROBERT', 'Tonight. Between eight and nine. Come. I will wait for you tonight. And every night. You will?'),
(290, '1', '317', 'BERTHA', 'The gate opened.'),
(291, '1', '318', 'ROBERT', 'I will wait for you.'),
(292, '1', '319', 'RICHARD', 'Good afternoon.'),
(293, '1', '320', 'ROBERT', 'Good afternoon, Richard.'),
(294, '1', '321', 'BERTHA', 'Look what lovely roses Mr Hand brought me.'),
(295, '1', '322', 'ROBERT', 'I am afraid they are overblown.'),
(296, '1', '323', 'RICHARD', 'Excuse me for a moment, will you?'),
(297, '1', '324', 'ROBERT', 'The address. Take the tram at Lansdowne Road and ask to be let down near there.'),
(298, '1', '325', 'BERTHA', 'I promise nothing.'),
(299, '1', '326', 'ROBERT', 'I will wait.'),
(300, '1', '327', 'BERTHA', 'I must put these roses in water.'),
(301, '1', '328', 'RICHARD', 'Yes, do. And please put my hat on the rack.'),
(302, '1', '329', 'BERTHA', 'Do you want anything? Cigarettes?'),
(303, '1', '330', 'RICHARD', 'Thanks. We have them here.'),
(304, '1', '331', 'BERTHA', 'Then I can go?'),
(305, '1', '332', 'RICHARD', 'Your place of honour.'),
(306, '1', '333', 'ROBERT', 'Good Lord, how warm it is today! The heat pains me here in the eye. The glare.'),
(307, '1', '334', 'RICHARD', 'The room is rather dark, I think, with the blind down but if you wish...'),
(308, '1', '335', 'ROBERT', 'Not at all. I know what it is-- the result of night work.'),
(309, '1', '336', 'RICHARD', 'Must you?'),
(310, '1', '337', 'ROBERT', 'Eh, yes. I must see part of the paper through every night. And then my leading articles. We are approaching a difficult moment. And not only here.'),
(311, '1', '338', 'RICHARD', 'Have you any news?'),
(312, '1', '339', 'ROBERT', 'Yes. I want to speak to you seriously. Today may be an important day for you-- or rather, tonight. I saw the vicechancellor this morning. He has the highest opinion of you, Richard. He has read your book, he said.'),
(313, '1', '340', 'RICHARD', 'Did he buy it or borrow it?'),
(314, '1', '341', 'ROBERT', 'Bought it, I hope.'),
(315, '1', '342', 'RICHARD', 'I shall smoke a cigarette. Thirty-seven copies have now been sold in Dublin.'),
(316, '1', '343', 'ROBERT', 'Well, the matter is closed for the present. You have your iron mask on today.'),
(317, '1', '344', 'RICHARD', 'Let me hear the rest.'),
(318, '1', '345', 'ROBERT', 'Richard, you are too suspicious. It is a defect in you. He assured me he has the highest possible opinion of you, as everyone has. You are the man for the post, he says. In fact, he told me that, if your name goes forward, he will work might and main for you with the senate and I... will do my part, of course, in the press and privately. I regard it as a public duty. The chair of romance literature is yours by right, as a scholar, as a literary personality.'),
(319, '1', '346', 'RICHARD', 'The conditions?'),
(320, '1', '347', 'ROBERT', 'Conditions? You mean about the future?'),
(321, '1', '348', 'RICHARD', 'I mean about the past.'),
(322, '1', '349', 'ROBERT', 'That episode in your past is forgotten. An act of impulse. We are all impulsive'),
(323, '1', '350', 'RICHARD', 'You called it an act of folly, then-- nine years ago. You told me I was hanging a weight about my neck.'),
(324, '1', '352', 'RICHARD', 'Writing one of your leading articles, in fact.'),
(325, '1', '353', 'ROBERT', 'Put it so. Well, it made a great sensation at the time. A mysterious disappearance. My name was involved too, as best man, let us say, on that famous occasion. Of course, they think I acted from a mistaken sense of friendship. Well, all that is known.  But what happened afterwards is not known.'),
(326, '1', '354', 'RICHARD', 'No?'),
(327, '1', '356', 'RICHARD', 'Do you, or do you not, want me to give the lie to my past life?'),
(328, '1', '357', 'ROBERT', 'I am thinking of your future life-- here. I understand your pride and your sense of liberty. I understand their point of view also. However, there is a way out; it is simply this. Refrain from contradicting any rumours you may hear concerning what happened.... or did not happen after you went away. Leave the rest to me.'),
(329, '1', '358', 'RICHARD', 'You will set these rumours afloat?'),
(330, '1', '359', 'ROBERT', 'I will. God help me.'),
(331, '1', '360', 'RICHARD', 'For the sake of social conventions?'),
(332, '1', '361', 'ROBERT', 'For the sake of something else too-- our friendship, our lifelong friendship.'),
(333, '1', '362', 'RICHARD', 'Thanks.'),
(334, '1', '363', 'ROBERT', 'And I will tell you the whole truth.'),
(335, '1', '364', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. Do, please.'),
(336, '1', '365', 'ROBERT', 'Not only for your sake. Also for the sake of-- your present partner in life.'),
(337, '1', '366', 'RICHARD', 'I see.'),
(338, '1', '367', 'RICHARD', 'Why for her sake?'),
(339, '1', '368', 'ROBERT', 'Richard, have you been quite fair to her? It was her own free choice, you will say. But was she really free to choose? She was a mere girl. She accepted all that you proposed.'),
(340, '1', '369', 'RICHARD', 'That is your way of saying that she proposed what I would not accept.'),
(341, '1', '370', 'ROBERT', 'I remember. And she went away with you. But was it of her own free choice? Answer me frankly.'),
(342, '1', '371', 'RICHARD', 'I played for her against all that you say or can say; and I won.'),
(343, '1', '372', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, you won.'),
(344, '1', '373', 'RICHARD', 'Excuse me for forgetting. Will you have some whisky?'),
(345, '1', '374', 'ROBERT', 'All things come to those who wait.'),
(346, '1', '375', 'RICHARD', 'Will you please help yourself?'),
(347, '1', '376', 'ROBERT', 'Lord, when I think of our wild nights long ago-- talks by the hour, plans, carouses, revelry...'),
(348, '1', '377', 'RICHARD', 'In our house.'),
(349, '1', '379', 'RICHARD', 'It was not only a house of revelry; it was to be the hearth of a new life.  And in that name all our sins were committed.'),
(350, '1', '380', 'ROBERT', 'Sins! Drinking and blasphemy  by you-- are those the sins you mean?'),
(351, '1', '381', 'RICHARD', 'And some others.'),
(352, '1', '382', 'ROBERT', 'Have you?'),
(353, '1', '383', 'RICHARD', 'For you it was all quite natural?'),
(354, '1', '384', 'ROBERT', 'For me it is quite natural to kiss a woman whom I like. Why not? She is beautiful for me.'),
(355, '1', '385', 'RICHARD', 'Do you kiss everything that is beautiful for you?'),
(356, '1', '386', 'ROBERT', 'Everything-- if it can be kissed.  And so I kiss it because it is beautiful. And what is a woman? A work of nature, too, like a stone or a flower or a bird. A kiss is an act of homage.'),
(357, '1', '387', 'RICHARD', 'It is an act of union between man and woman. Even if we are often led to desire through the sense of beauty can you say that the beautiful is what we desire?'),
(358, '1', '388', 'ROBERT', 'You will give me a headache if you make me think today. I cannot think today. I feel too natural, too common. After all, what is most attractive in even the most beautiful woman?'),
(359, '1', '389', 'RICHARD', 'What?'),
(360, '1', '390', 'ROBERT', 'Not those qualities which she has and other women have not but the qualities which she has in common with them. I mean... the commonest.  I am very common today. Perhaps that idea never struck you?'),
(361, '1', '391', 'RICHARD', 'Many ideas strike a man who has lived nine years with a woman.'),
(362, '1', '392', 'ROBERT', 'Yes. I suppose they do.... This beautiful cool stone does me good. Is it a paperweight or a cure for headache?'),
(363, '1', '393', 'RICHARD', 'Bertha brought it home one day from the strand. She, too, says that it is beautiful.'),
(364, '1', '394', 'ROBERT', 'She is right.'),
(365, '1', '395', 'RICHARD', 'Is that all you wanted to say to me?'),
(366, '1', '396', 'ROBERT', 'I thought you might have forgotten. Strictly private, of course. He wants to meet you again and sends you a very warm invitation.'),
(367, '1', '397', 'RICHARD', 'For what hour?'),
(368, '1', '398', 'ROBERT', 'Eight. But, like yourself, he is free and easy about time. Now, Richard, you must go there. That is all. I feel tonight will be the turningpoint in your life. You will live here and work here and think here and be honoured here-- among our people.'),
(369, '1', '399', 'RICHARD', 'I can almost see two envoys starting for the United States to collect funds for my statue a hundred years hence.'),
(370, '1', '400', 'ROBERT', ''),
(371, '1', '401', 'RICHARD', 'The second one for me, please.'),
(372, '1', '402', 'ROBERT', 'Will you give me one of those long cigars of yours?'),
(373, '1', '403', 'ROBERT', 'These cigars Europeanize me. If Ireland is to become a new Ireland she must first become European. And that is what you are here for, Richard. Some day we shall have to choose between England and Europe. I am a descendant of the dark foreigners: that is why I like to be here. I may be childish. But where else in Dublin can I get a bandit cigar like this or a cup of black coffee? The man who drinks black coffee is going to conquer Ireland. And now I will take just a half measure of that whisky, Richard, to show you there is no ill feeling.'),
(374, '1', '404', 'RICHARD', 'Help yourself.'),
(375, '1', '406', 'RICHARD', 'O, why not?'),
(376, '1', '407', 'ROBERT', 'You have that fierce indignation which lacerated the heart of Swift. You have fallen from a higher world, Richard, and you are filled with fierce indignation, when you find that life is cowardly and ignoble. While I... shall I tell you?'),
(377, '1', '408', 'RICHARD', 'By all means.'),
(378, '1', '409', 'ROBERT', 'I have come up from a lower world and I am filled with astonishment when I find that people have any redeeming virtue at all.'),
(379, '1', '410', 'RICHARD', 'You are my friend, then?'),
(380, '1', '411', 'ROBERT', 'I fought for you all the time you were away. I fought to bring you back. I fought to keep your place for you here. I will fight for you still because I have faith in you, the faith of a disciple in his master. I cannot say more than that. It may seem strange to you... Give me a match.'),
(381, '1', '412', 'RICHARD', 'There is a faith still stranger than the faith of the disciple in his master.'),
(382, '1', '413', 'ROBERT', 'And that is?'),
(383, '1', '414', 'RICHARD', 'The faith of a master in the disciple who will betray him.'),
(384, '1', '415', 'ROBERT', 'The church lost a theologian in you, Richard. But I think you look too deeply into life.  Be gay. Life is not worth it.'),
(385, '1', '416', 'RICHARD', 'Are you going?'),
(386, '1', '418', 'RICHARD', 'Good.'),
(387, '1', '419', 'ROBERT', 'One more match and I am happy.'),
(388, '1', '420', 'ROBERT', 'Congratulate me, Beatty. I have won over Richard.'),
(389, '1', '421', 'ARCHIE', 'Mamma, Miss Justice is going.'),
(390, '1', '422', 'BEATRICE', 'On what are you to be congratulated?'),
(391, '1', '423', 'ROBERT', 'On a victory, of course.  The descendant of Archibald Hamilton Rowan has come home.'),
(392, '1', '424', 'RICHARD', 'I am not a descendant of Hamilton Rowan.'),
(393, '1', '425', 'ROBERT', 'What matter?'),
(394, '1', '426', 'BEATRICE', 'Has Mr Rowan...?'),
(395, '1', '427', 'ROBERT', 'Good afternoon, Richard. We shall meet tonight.'),
(396, '1', '428', 'RICHARD', 'At Philippi.'),
(397, '1', '429', 'BEATRICE', 'Accept my best wishes, Mr Rowan.'),
(398, '1', '430', 'RICHARD', 'Thanks. But do not believe him.'),
(399, '1', '431', 'ROBERT', 'Good afternoon, Mrs Rowan.'),
(400, '1', '433', 'BEATRICE', 'No, thank you.'),
(401, '1', '434', 'ROBERT', 'Archibald.'),
(402, '1', '435', 'ARCHIE', ''),
(403, '1', '436', 'ROBERT', 'Wait, Beatty. I shall accompany you.'),
(404, '1', '438', 'ROBERT', 'But I insist-- as a cousin.'),
(405, '1', '439', 'ARCHIE', 'I say, pappie!'),
(406, '1', '440', 'RICHARD', 'What is it?'),
(407, '1', '441', 'ARCHIE', 'I want to ask you a thing.'),
(408, '1', '442', 'RICHARD', 'What is it?'),
(409, '1', '443', 'ARCHIE', 'Will you ask mamma to let me go out in the morning with the milkman?'),
(410, '1', '444', 'RICHARD', 'With the milkman?'),
(411, '1', '445', 'ARCHIE', 'Yes. In the milkcar. He says he will let me drive when we get on to the roads where there are no people. The horse is a very good beast. Can I go?'),
(412, '1', '446', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(413, '1', '447', 'ARCHIE', 'Ask mamma now can I go. Will you?'),
(414, '1', '448', 'RICHARD', 'I will.'),
(415, '1', '449', 'ARCHIE', 'He said he will show me the cows he has in the field. Do you know how many cows he has?'),
(416, '1', '450', 'RICHARD', 'How many?'),
(417, '1', '451', 'ARCHIE', 'Eleven. Eight red and three white. But one is sick now. No, not sick. But it fell.'),
(418, '1', '452', 'RICHARD', 'Cows?'),
(419, '1', '453', 'ARCHIE', 'Eh! Not bulls. Because bulls give no milk. Eleven cows. They must give a lot of milk. What makes a cow give milk?'),
(420, '1', '454', 'RICHARD', 'Who knows? Do you understand what it is to give a thing?'),
(421, '1', '455', 'ARCHIE', 'To give? Yes.'),
(422, '1', '456', 'RICHARD', 'While you have a thing it can be taken from you.'),
(423, '1', '457', 'ARCHIE', 'By robbers? No?'),
(424, '1', '458', 'RICHARD', 'But when you give it, you have given it. No robber can take it from you.  It is yours then for ever when you have given it. It will be yours always. That is to give.'),
(425, '1', '459', 'ARCHIE', 'But, pappie?'),
(426, '1', '460', 'RICHARD', 'Yes?'),
(427, '1', '461', 'ARCHIE', 'How could a robber rob a cow? Everyone would see him. In the night, perhaps.'),
(428, '1', '462', 'RICHARD', 'In the night, yes.'),
(429, '1', '463', 'ARCHIE', 'Are there robbers here like in Rome?'),
(430, '1', '464', 'RICHARD', 'There are poor people everywhere.'),
(431, '1', '465', 'ARCHIE', 'Have they revolvers?'),
(432, '1', '466', 'RICHARD', 'No.'),
(433, '1', '467', 'ARCHIE', 'Knives? Have they knives?'),
(434, '1', '468', 'RICHARD', 'Yes, yes. Knives and revolvers.'),
(435, '1', '469', 'ARCHIE', 'Ask mamma now. She is coming.'),
(436, '1', '470', 'RICHARD', 'I will.'),
(437, '1', '472', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. Go.'),
(438, '1', '473', 'ARCHIE', 'Thanks.'),
(439, '1', '474', 'RICHARD', 'Well?'),
(440, '1', '475', 'BERTHA', 'Well. He says he likes me.'),
(441, '1', '476', 'RICHARD', 'You showed him his note?'),
(442, '1', '477', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. I asked him what it meant.'),
(443, '1', '478', 'RICHARD', 'What did he say it meant?'),
(444, '1', '479', 'BERTHA', 'He said I must know. I said I had an idea. Then he told me he liked me very much. That I was beautiful-- and all that.'),
(445, '1', '480', 'RICHARD', 'Since when!'),
(446, '1', '481', 'BERTHA', 'Since when-- what?'),
(447, '1', '482', 'RICHARD', 'Since when did he say he liked you?'),
(448, '1', '483', 'BERTHA', 'Always, he said. But more since we came back. He said I was like the moon in this lavender dress.  Had you any words with him-- about me?'),
(449, '1', '484', 'RICHARD', 'The usual thing. Not about you.'),
(450, '1', '485', 'BERTHA', 'He was very nervous. You saw that?'),
(451, '1', '486', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. I saw it. What else went on?'),
(452, '1', '487', 'BERTHA', 'He asked me to give him my hand.'),
(453, '1', '488', 'RICHARD', 'In marriage?'),
(454, '1', '489', 'BERTHA', 'No, only to hold.'),
(455, '1', '490', 'RICHARD', 'Did you?'),
(456, '1', '491', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.  Then he caressed my hand and asked would I let him kiss it. I let him.'),
(457, '1', '492', 'RICHARD', 'Well?'),
(458, '1', '493', 'BERTHA', 'Then he asked could he embrace me-- even once? ..and then...'),
(459, '1', '494', 'RICHARD', 'And then?'),
(460, '1', '495', 'BERTHA', 'He put his arm round me.'),
(461, '1', '496', 'RICHARD', 'And then?'),
(462, '1', '497', 'BERTHA', 'He said I had beautiful eyes. And asked could he kiss them.'),
(463, '1', '498', 'RICHARD', 'And he did?'),
(464, '1', '500', 'RICHARD', 'I know, dear. But I want to find out what he means or feels just as you do.'),
(465, '1', '501', 'BERTHA', 'Remember, you allowed me to go on. I told you the whole thing from the beginning.'),
(466, '1', '502', 'RICHARD', 'I know, dear... And then?'),
(467, '1', '503', 'BERTHA', 'He asked for a kiss. I said:'),
(468, '1', '504', 'RICHARD', 'And then?'),
(469, '1', '505', 'BERTHA', 'He kissed me.'),
(470, '1', '506', 'RICHARD', 'Your mouth?'),
(471, '1', '507', 'BERTHA', 'Once or twice.'),
(472, '1', '508', 'RICHARD', 'Long kisses?'),
(473, '1', '509', 'BERTHA', 'Fairly long.  Yes, the last time.'),
(474, '1', '510', 'RICHARD', 'With his lips? Or... the other way?'),
(475, '1', '511', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, the last time.'),

(530, '1', '569', 'BERTHA', 'Because you never loved your own mother. A mother is always a mother, no matter what. I never heard of any human being that did not love the mother that brought him into the world, except you.'),

If he did it, or other men, I could understand because they are all false pretenders. But you, Dick! Why do you not tell him then?'),

(568, '1', '613', 'BERTHA', 'I do. But I believe you will get very little from her in return-- or from any of her clan. Remember my words, Dick. Because she is not generous and they are not generous. Is it all wrong what I am saying? Is it?'),

(723, '2', '134', 'ROBERT', 'My dear Richard, my dear friend, I swear to you I could not make you suffer.'),
(724, '2', '135', 'RICHARD', 'You may then know in soul and body, in a hundred forms, and ever restlessly, what some old theologian, Duns Scotus, I think, called a death of the spirit.'),
(725, '2', '136', 'ROBERT', 'A death. No; its affirmation! A death! The supreme instant of life from which all coming life proceeds, the eternal law of nature herself.'),
(726, '2', '137', 'RICHARD', 'And that other law of nature, as you call it: change. How will it be when you turn against her and against me; when her beauty, or what seems so to you now, wearies you and my affection for you seems false and odious?'),
(727, '2', '138', 'ROBERT', 'That will never be. Never.'),
(728, '2', '139', 'RICHARD', 'And you turn even against yourself for having known me or trafficked with us both?'),
(729, '2', '140', 'ROBERT', 'It will never be like that, Richard. Be sure of that.'),
(730, '2', '141', 'RICHARD', 'I care very little whether it is or not because there is something I fear much more.'),
(731, '2', '142', 'ROBERT', 'You fear? I disbelieve you, Richard. Since we were boys together I have followed your mind. You do not know what moral fear is.'),
(732, '2', '143', 'RICHARD', ''),
(733, '2', '144', 'ROBERT', 'Do not suffer, Richard. There is no need. She is loyal to you, body and soul. Why do you fear?'),
(734, '2', '145', 'RICHARD', 'Not that fear. But that I will reproach myself then for having taken all for myself because I would not suffer her to give to another what was hers and not mine to give, because I accepted from her her loyalty and made her life poorer in love. That is my fear. That I stand between her and any moments of life that should be hers, between her and you, between her and anyone, between her and anything. I will not do it. I cannot and I will not. I dare not.'),
(735, '2', '146', 'ROBERT', 'Look here, Richard. We have said all there is to be said. Let the past be past.'),
(736, '2', '147', 'RICHARD', 'Wait. One thing more. For you, too, must know me as I am-- now.'),
(737, '2', '148', 'ROBERT', 'More? Is there more?'),
(738, '2', '149', 'RICHARD', 'I told you that when I saw your eyes this afternoon I felt sad. Your humility and confusion, I felt, united you to me in brotherhood.  At that moment I felt our whole life together in the past, and I longed to put my arm around your neck.'),
(739, '2', '150', 'ROBERT', 'It is noble of you, Richard, to forgive me like this.'),
(740, '2', '151', 'RICHARD', 'I told you that I wished you not to do anything false and secret against me-- against our friendship, against her; not to steal her from me craftily, secretly, meanly-- in the dark, in the night-- you, Robert, my friend.'),
(741, '2', '152', 'ROBERT', 'I know. And it was noble of you.'),
(742, '2', '153', 'RICHARD', 'No. Not noble. Ignoble.'),
(743, '2', '154', 'ROBERT', 'How? Why?'),
(744, '2', '155', 'RICHARD', 'That is what I must tell you too. Because in the very core of my ignoble heart I longed to be betrayed by you and by her-- in the dark, in the night-- secretly, meanly, craftily. By you, my best friend, and by her. I longed for that passionately and ignobly, to be dishonoured for ever in love and in lust, to be...'),
(745, '2', '156', 'ROBERT', 'But no. Go on.'),
(746, '2', '157', 'RICHARD', 'To be for ever a shameful creature and to build up my soul again out of the ruins of its shame.'),
(747, '2', '158', 'ROBERT', 'And that is why you wished that she...'),
(748, '2', '159', 'RICHARD', 'She has spoken always of her innocence, as I have spoken always of my guilt, humbling me.'),
(749, '2', '160', 'ROBERT', 'From pride, then?'),
(750, '2', '161', 'RICHARD', 'From pride and from ignoble longing. And from a motive deeper still.'),
(751, '2', '162', 'ROBERT', 'I understand you.'),
(752, '2', '163', 'ROBERT', 'May it not be that we are here and now in the presence of a moment which will free us both-- me as well as you-- from the last bonds of what is called morality. My friendship for you has laid bonds on me.'),
(753, '2', '164', 'RICHARD', 'Light bonds, apparently.'),
(754, '2', '165', 'ROBERT', 'I acted in the dark, secretly. I will do so no longer. Have you the courage to allow me to act freely?'),
(755, '2', '166', 'RICHARD', 'A duel-- between us?'),
(756, '2', '167', 'ROBERT', 'A battle of both our souls, different as they are, against all that is false in them and in the world. A battle of your soul against the spectre of fidelity, of mine against the spectre of friendship. All life is a conquest, the victory of human passion over the commandments of cowardice. Will you, Richard? Have you the courage? Even if it shatters to atoms the friendship between us, even if it breaks up for ever the last illusion in your own life? There was an eternity before we were born: another will come after we are dead. The blinding instant of passion alone-- passion, free, unashamed, irresistible-- that is the only gate by which we can escape from the misery of what slaves call life. Is not this the language of your own youth that I heard so often from you in this very place where we are sitting now? Have you changed?'),
(757, '2', '168', 'RICHARD', 'Yes. It is the language of my youth.'),
(758, '2', '169', 'ROBERT', 'Richard, you have driven me up to this point. She and I have only obeyed your will. You yourself have roused these words in my brain. Your own words. Shall we? Freely? Together?'),
(759, '2', '170', 'RICHARD', 'Together no. Fight your part alone. I will not free you. Leave me to fight mine.'),
(760, '2', '171', 'ROBERT', 'You allow me, then?'),
(761, '2', '172', 'RICHARD', 'Free yourself.'),
(762, '2', '173', 'ROBERT', 'What does this mean?'),
(763, '2', '174', 'RICHARD', 'Bertha, evidently. Did you not ask her to come?'),
(764, '2', '175', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, but...  Then I am going, Richard.'),
(765, '2', '176', 'RICHARD', 'No. I am going.'),
(766, '2', '177', 'ROBERT', 'Richard, I appeal to you. Let me go. It is over. She is yours. Keep her and forgive me, both of you.'),
(767, '2', '178', 'RICHARD', 'Because you are generous enough to allow me?'),
(768, '2', '179', 'ROBERT', 'Richard, you will make me angry with you if you say that.'),
(769, '2', '180', 'RICHARD', 'Angry or not, I will not live on your generosity. You have asked her to meet you here tonight and alone. Solve the question between you.'),
(770, '2', '181', 'ROBERT', 'Explain to her, Richard, as best you can. I cannot see her now.'),
(771, '2', '182', 'RICHARD', 'I shall go. I tell you. Wait out there if you wish.'),
(772, '2', '183', 'ROBERT', 'An umbrella!  O!'),
(773, '2', '184', 'RICHARD', 'Welcome back to old Ireland!'),
(774, '2', '185', 'BERTHA', 'Is this the place?'),
(775, '2', '186', 'RICHARD', 'Yes, it is. How did you find it?'),
(776, '2', '188', 'RICHARD', 'He is waiting. Out there. He was waiting when I came.'),
(777, '2', '189', 'BERTHA', 'You see, you came after all.'),
(778, '2', '190', 'RICHARD', 'Did you think I would not?'),
(779, '2', '191', 'BERTHA', 'I knew you could not remain away. You see, after all you are like all other men. You had to come. You are jealous like the others.'),
(780, '2', '192', 'RICHARD', 'You seem annoyed to find me here.'),
(781, '2', '193', 'BERTHA', 'What happened between you?'),
(782, '2', '194', 'RICHARD', 'I told him I knew everything, that I had known for a long time. He asked how. I said from you.'),
(783, '2', '195', 'BERTHA', 'Does he hate me?'),
(784, '2', '196', 'RICHARD', 'I cannot read in his heart.'),
(785, '2', '197', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. He hates me. He believes I made a fool of him-- betrayed him. I knew he would.'),
(786, '2', '198', 'RICHARD', 'I told him you were sincere with him.'),
(787, '2', '199', 'BERTHA', 'He does not believe it. Nobody would believe it. I should have told him first-- not you.'),
(788, '2', '200', 'RICHARD', 'I thought he was a common robber, prepared to use even violence against you. I had to protect you from that.'),
(789, '2', '201', 'BERTHA', 'That I could have done myself.'),
(790, '2', '202', 'RICHARD', 'Are you sure?'),
(791, '2', '203', 'BERTHA', 'It would have been enough to have told him that you knew I was here. Now I can find out nothing. He hates me. He is right to hate me. I have treated him badly, shamefully.'),
(792, '2', '204', 'RICHARD', 'Bertha, look at me.'),
(793, '2', '205', 'BERTHA', 'Well?'),
(794, '2', '206', 'RICHARD', 'I cannot read in your heart either.'),
(795, '2', '207', 'BERTHA', 'You could not remain away. Do you not trust me? You can see I am quite calm. I could have hidden it all from you.'),
(796, '2', '208', 'RICHARD', 'I doubt that.'),
(797, '2', '209', 'BERTHA', 'O, easily if I had wanted to.'),
(798, '2', '210', 'RICHARD', 'Perhaps you are sorry now that you did not.'),
(799, '2', '211', 'BERTHA', 'Perhaps I am.'),
(800, '2', '212', 'RICHARD', 'What a fool you were to tell me! It would have been so nice if you had kept it secret.'),
(801, '2', '213', 'BERTHA', 'As you do, no?'),
(802, '2', '214', 'RICHARD', 'As I do, yes.  Goodbye for a while.'),
(803, '2', '215', 'BERTHA', 'Are you going?'),
(804, '2', '216', 'RICHARD', 'Naturally. My part is ended here.'),
(805, '2', '217', 'BERTHA', 'To her, I suppose?'),
(806, '2', '218', 'RICHARD', 'Who?'),
(807, '2', '219', 'BERTHA', 'Her ladyship. I suppose it is all planned so that you may have a good opportunity to meet her and have an intellectual conversation!'),
(808, '2', '221', 'BERTHA', 'Very well. You can go. Now I know what to do.'),
(809, '2', '224', 'RICHARD', 'Then you have come here and led him on in this way on account of me. Is that how it is?'),
(810, '2', '225', 'BERTHA', 'There is one person in all this who is not a fool. And that is you. I am though. And he is.'),
(811, '2', '226', 'RICHARD', 'If so you have indeed treated him badly and shamefully.'),
(812, '2', '227', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. But it was your fault. And I will end it now. I am simply a tool for you. You have no respect for me. You never had because I did what I did.'),
(813, '2', '228', 'RICHARD', 'And has he respect?'),
(814, '2', '229', 'BERTHA', 'He has. Of all the persons I met since I came back he is the only one who has. And he knows what they only suspect. And that is why I liked him from the first and like him still. Great respect for me she has! Why did you not ask her to come away with you nine years ago?'),
(815, '2', '230', 'RICHARD', 'You know why, Bertha. Ask yourself.'),
(816, '2', '231', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, I know why. You knew the answer you would get. That is why.'),
(817, '2', '232', 'RICHARD', 'That is not why. I did not even ask you.'),
(818, '2', '233', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. You knew I would go, asked or not. I do things. But if I do one thing I can do two things. As I have the name I can have the gains.'),
(819, '2', '234', 'RICHARD', 'Bertha, I accept what is to be. I have trusted you. I will trust you still.'),
(820, '2', '235', 'BERTHA', 'To have that against me. To leave me then.  Why do you not defend me then against him? Why do you go away from me now without a word? Dick, my God, tell me what you wish me to do?'),
(821, '2', '236', 'RICHARD', 'I cannot, dear.  I have a wild delight in my soul, Bertha, as I look at you. I see you as you are yourself. That I came first in your life or before him then-- that may be nothing to you. You may be his more than mine.'),
(822, '2', '237', 'BERTHA', 'I am not. Only I feel for him, too.'),
(823, '2', '239', 'BERTHA', 'I will remain.'),
(824, '2', '240', 'RICHARD', 'Goodbye.'),
(825, '2', '241', 'BERTHA', 'Is anyone out there?'),
(826, '2', '242', 'BERTHA', 'Is anyone there?'),
(827, '2', '243', 'BERTHA', 'Robert!'),
(828, '2', '244', 'ROBERT', 'Are you alone?'),
(829, '2', '245', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(830, '2', '246', 'ROBERT', 'Where is he?'),
(831, '2', '247', 'BERTHA', 'Gone.  You startled me. Where did you come from?'),
(832, '2', '248', 'ROBERT', 'Out there. Did he not tell you I was out there-- waiting?'),
(833, '2', '249', 'BERTHA', 'Why do you stand like that in the doorway?'),
(834, '2', '250', 'ROBERT', 'Why? I am afraid too.'),
(835, '2', '251', 'BERTHA', 'Of what?'),
(836, '2', '252', 'ROBERT', 'Of you.'),
(837, '2', '253', 'BERTHA', 'Do you hate me now?'),
(838, '2', '254', 'ROBERT', 'I fear you.  I fear a new torture-- a new trap.'),
(839, '2', '255', 'BERTHA', 'For what do you blame me?'),
(840, '2', '256', 'ROBERT', 'Why did you lead me on? Day after day, more and more. Why did you not stop me? You could have-- with a word. But not even a word! I forgot myself and him. You saw it. That I was ruining myself in his eyes, losing his friendship. Did you want me to?'),
(841, '2', '257', 'BERTHA', 'You never asked me.'),
(842, '2', '258', 'ROBERT', 'Asked you what?'),
(843, '2', '259', 'BERTHA', 'If he suspected-- or knew.'),
(844, '2', '260', 'ROBERT', 'And would you have told me?'),
(845, '2', '261', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(846, '2', '262', 'ROBERT', 'Did you tell him-- everything?'),
(847, '2', '263', 'BERTHA', 'I did.'),
(848, '2', '264', 'ROBERT', 'I mean-- details.'),
(849, '2', '265', 'BERTHA', 'Everything.'),
(850, '2', '266', 'ROBERT', 'I see. You were making an experiment for his sake. On me. Well, why not? It seems I was a good subject. Still, it was a little cruel of you.'),
(851, '2', '267', 'BERTHA', 'Try to understand me, Robert. You must try.'),
(852, '2', '268', 'ROBERT', 'Well, I will try.'),
(853, '2', '269', 'BERTHA', 'Why do you stand like that near the door? It makes me nervous to look at you.'),
(854, '2', '270', 'ROBERT', 'I am trying to understand. And then I am afraid.'),
(855, '2', '271', 'BERTHA', 'You need not be afraid.'),
(856, '2', '272', 'ROBERT', 'But now I must be good or you may laugh over me again-- tonight.'),
(857, '2', '273', 'BERTHA', 'O, you poor fellow! Out there in the rain all that time! I forgot that.'),
(858, '2', '274', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, you forgot the climate.'),
(859, '2', '275', 'BERTHA', 'But you are really drenched. You must change your coat.'),
(860, '2', '276', 'ROBERT', 'Tell me, it is pity then that you feel for me, as he-- as Richard-- says?'),
(861, '2', '277', 'BERTHA', 'Please change your coat, Robert, when I ask you. You might get a very bad cold from that. Do, please.'),
(862, '2', '278', 'ROBERT', 'What would it matter now?'),
(863, '2', '279', 'BERTHA', 'Where do you keep your clothes here?'),
(864, '2', '280', 'ROBERT', 'In my bedroom.'),
(865, '2', '281', 'BERTHA', 'Well, go in and take that off.'),
(866, '2', '282', 'ROBERT', 'And you?'),
(867, '2', '283', 'BERTHA', 'I will wait here for you.'),
(868, '2', '284', 'ROBERT', 'Do you command me to?'),
(869, '2', '285', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, I command you.'),
(870, '2', '288', 'ROBERT', 'Only a moment.'),
(871, '2', '289', 'ROBERT', 'You have not gone?'),
(872, '2', '290', 'BERTHA', 'No.'),
(873, '2', '291', 'ROBERT', 'I am in the dark here. I must light the lamp.'),
(874, '2', '292', 'ROBERT', 'Do you like the effect of the light?'),
(875, '2', '293', 'BERTHA', 'O, yes.'),
(876, '2', '294', 'ROBERT', 'Can you admire it from where you are?'),
(877, '2', '295', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, quite well.'),
(878, '2', '296', 'ROBERT', 'It was for you.'),
(879, '2', '297', 'BERTHA', 'I am not worthy even of that.'),
(880, '2', '299', 'BERTHA', 'Robert!'),
(881, '2', '300', 'ROBERT', 'Yes?'),
(882, '2', '301', 'BERTHA', 'Come here, quickly! Quickly, I say!'),
(883, '2', '302', 'ROBERT', 'I am ready.'),
(884, '2', '303', 'ROBERT', 'What is it, Bertha?'),
(885, '2', '304', 'BERTHA', 'I was afraid.'),
(886, '2', '305', 'ROBERT', 'Of being alone?'),
(887, '2', '306', 'BERTHA', 'You know what I mean. My nerves are all upset.'),
(888, '2', '307', 'ROBERT', 'That I...?'),
(889, '2', '308', 'BERTHA', 'Promise me, Robert, not to think of such a thing. Never. If you like me at all. I thought that moment...'),
(890, '2', '309', 'ROBERT', 'What an idea?'),
(891, '2', '310', 'BERTHA', 'But promise me if you like me.'),
(892, '2', '311', 'ROBERT', 'If I like you, Bertha! I promise. Of course, I promise. You are trembling all over.'),
(893, '2', '312', 'BERTHA', 'Let me sit down somewhere. It will pass in a moment.'),
(894, '2', '313', 'ROBERT', 'My poor Bertha! Sit down. Come.'),
(895, '2', '314', 'ROBERT', 'Has it passed?'),
(896, '2', '315', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. It was only for a moment. I was very silly. I was afraid that... I wanted to see you near me.'),
(897, '2', '316', 'ROBERT', 'That... that you made me promise not to think of?'),
(898, '2', '317', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(899, '2', '318', 'ROBERT', 'Or something else?'),
(900, '2', '319', 'BERTHA', 'Robert, I feared something. I am not sure what.'),
(901, '2', '320', 'ROBERT', 'And now?'),
(902, '2', '321', 'BERTHA', 'Now you are here. I can see you. Now it has passed.'),
(903, '2', '323', 'BERTHA', 'Listen, Robert. I want to explain to you about that. I could not deceive Dick. Never. In nothing. I told him everything-- from the first. Then it went on and on; and still you never spoke or asked me. I wanted you to.'),
(904, '2', '324', 'ROBERT', 'Is that the truth, Bertha?'),
(905, '2', '325', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, because it annoyed me that you could think I was like... like the other women I suppose you knew that way. I think that Dick is right too. Why should there be secrets?'),
(906, '2', '326', 'ROBERT', 'Still, secrets can be very sweet. Can they not?'),
(907, '2', '327', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, I know they can. But, you see, I could not keep things secret from Dick. Besides, what is the good? They always come out in the end. Is it not better for people to know?'),
(908, '2', '328', 'ROBERT', 'How could you, Bertha, tell him everything? Did you? Every single thing that passed between us?'),
(909, '2', '329', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. Everything he asked me.'),
(910, '2', '330', 'ROBERT', 'Did he ask you-- much?'),
(911, '2', '331', 'BERTHA', 'You know the kind he is. He asks about everything. The ins and outs.'),
(912, '2', '332', 'ROBERT', 'About our kissing, too?'),
(913, '2', '333', 'BERTHA', 'Of course. I told him all.'),
(914, '2', '334', 'ROBERT', 'Extraordinary little person! Were you not ashamed?'),
(915, '2', '335', 'BERTHA', 'No.'),
(916, '2', '336', 'ROBERT', 'Not a bit?'),
(917, '2', '337', 'BERTHA', 'No. Why? Is that terrible?'),
(918, '2', '338', 'ROBERT', 'And how did he take it? Tell me. I want to know everything, too.'),
(919, '2', '339', 'BERTHA', 'It excited him. More than usual.'),
(920, '2', '340', 'ROBERT', 'Why? Is he excitable-- still?'),
(921, '2', '341', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, very. When he is not lost in his philosophy.'),
(922, '2', '342', 'ROBERT', 'More than I?'),
(923, '2', '343', 'BERTHA', 'More than you?  How could I answer that? You both are, I suppose?'),
(924, '2', '344', 'BERTHA', 'Are you angry with me again?'),
(925, '2', '345', 'ROBERT', 'You are with me.'),
(926, '2', '346', 'BERTHA', 'No, Robert. Why should I?'),
(927, '2', '347', 'ROBERT', 'Because I asked you to come to this place. I tried to prepare it for you.  A sense of quietness.'),
(928, '2', '348', 'BERTHA', 'And this, too. Your nice velvet coat.'),
(929, '2', '349', 'ROBERT', 'Also. I will keep no secrets from you.'),
(930, '2', '350', 'BERTHA', 'You remind me of someone in a picture. I like you in it... But you are not angry, are you?'),
(931, '2', '351', 'ROBERT', 'But what else could I have done?'),
(932, '2', '352', 'BERTHA', 'You mean because others have been here?'),
(933, '2', '353', 'ROBERT', 'Yes.'),
(934, '2', '354', 'BERTHA', 'But I knew that before I came. I am not angry with you for it.'),
(935, '2', '355', 'ROBERT', 'Why should you be angry with me after all? You are not even angry with him-- for the same thing-- or worse.'),
(936, '2', '356', 'BERTHA', 'Did he tell you that about himself?'),
(937, '2', '357', 'ROBERT', 'Yes. He told me. We all confess to one another here. Turn about.'),
(938, '2', '358', 'BERTHA', 'I try to forget it.'),
(939, '2', '359', 'ROBERT', 'It does not trouble you?'),
(940, '2', '360', 'BERTHA', 'Not now. Only I dislike to think of it.'),
(941, '2', '361', 'ROBERT', 'It is merely something brutal, you think? Of little importance?'),
(942, '2', '362', 'BERTHA', 'It does not trouble me-- now.'),
(943, '2', '363', 'ROBERT', 'But there is something that would trouble you very much and that you would not try to forget?'),
(944, '2', '364', 'BERTHA', 'What?'),
(945, '2', '365', 'ROBERT', 'And perhaps brutal too. It usually comes to that sooner or later. Would you try to forget and forgive that?'),
(946, '2', '366', 'BERTHA', 'In whom?'),
(947, '2', '367', 'ROBERT', 'In anyone. In me.'),
(948, '2', '368', 'BERTHA', 'You mean in Dick.'),

(954, '2', '374', 'BERTHA', 'But why do you ask me such a lot of questions, Robert?'),
(955, '2', '375', 'ROBERT', 'Because I had another gift to offer you then-- a common simple gift-- like myself. If you want to know it I will tell you.'),

(964, '2', '384', 'ROBERT', 'now. We were left here for this. And you are wrong, Bertha. The past is not past. It is present here now. My feeling for you is the same now as it was then, because then-- you slighted it.'),
(965, '2', '385', 'BERTHA', 'No, Robert. I did not.'),
(966, '2', '386', 'ROBERT', 'You did. And I have felt it all these years without knowing it-- till now. Even while I lived-- the kind of life you know and dislike to think of-- the kind of life to which you condemned me.'),
(967, '2', '387', 'BERTHA', 'I?'),
(968, '2', '388', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, when you slighted the common simple gift I had to offer you-- and took his gift instead.'),
(969, '2', '389', 'BERTHA', 'But you never...'),
(970, '2', '390', 'ROBERT', 'No. Because you had chosen him. I saw that. I saw it on the first night we met, we three together. Why did you choose him?'),
(971, '2', '391', 'BERTHA', 'Is that not love?'),
(972, '2', '392', 'ROBERT', 'And every night when we two-- he and I-- came to that corner to meet you I saw it and felt it. You remember the corner, Bertha?'),
(973, '2', '393', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(974, '2', '394', 'ROBERT', 'And when you and he went away for your walk and I went along the street alone I felt it. And when he spoke to me about you and told me he was going away-- then most of all.'),
(975, '2', '395', 'BERTHA', 'Why then most of all?'),
(976, '2', '396', 'ROBERT', 'Because it was then that I was guilty of my first treason towards him.'),

(978, '2', '398', 'ROBERT', 'He did not. And you went all the same.'),
(979, '2', '399', 'BERTHA', 'I wanted to be with him. You know...  You know how we were then-- Dick and I.'),
(980, '2', '400', 'ROBERT', 'I advised him to go alone-- not to take you with him-- to live alone in order to see if what he felt for you was a passing thing which might ruin your happiness and his career.'),
(981, '2', '401', 'BERTHA', 'Well, Robert. It was unkind of you towards me. But I forgive you because you were thinking of his happiness and mine.'),
(982, '2', '402', 'ROBERT', 'No, Bertha. I was not. And that was my treason. I was thinking of myself-- that you might turn from him when he had gone and he from you. Then I would have offered you my gift. You know what it was now. The simple common gift that men offer to women. Not the best perhaps. Best or worst-- it would have been yours.'),
(983, '2', '403', 'BERTHA', 'He did not take your advice.'),
(984, '2', '404', 'ROBERT', 'No. And the night you ran away together-- O, how happy I was!'),
(985, '2', '405', 'BERTHA', 'Keep calm, Robert. I know you liked me always. Why did you not forget me?'),
(986, '2', '406', 'ROBERT', 'But why did you choose him? Did you not like me at all?'),
(987, '2', '407', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. I liked you because you were his friend. We often spoke about you. Often and often. Every time you wrote or sent papers or books to Dick. And I like you still, Robert.  I never forgot you.'),
(988, '2', '408', 'ROBERT', 'Nor I you. I knew I would see you again. I knew it the night you went away-- that you would come back. And that was why I wrote and worked to see you again-- here.'),
(989, '2', '409', 'BERTHA', 'And here I am. You were right.'),
(990, '2', '410', 'ROBERT', 'Nine years. Nine times more beautiful!'),

(1001, '2', '422', 'ROBERT', 'To make him-- Richard-- suffer.'),

(1003, '2', '424', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, yes. He does.'),
(1004, '2', '425', 'BERTHA', 'He knows we like each other. Is there any harm, then?'),
(1005, '2', '426', 'ROBERT', 'No there is no harm. Why should we not? He does not know yet what I feel. He has left us alone here at night, at this hour, because he longs to know it-- he longs to be delivered.'),
(1006, '2', '427', 'BERTHA', 'From what?'),
(1007, '2', '428', 'ROBERT', 'From every law, Bertha, from every bond. All his life he has sought to deliver himself. Every chain but one he has broken and that one we are to break. Bertha-- you and I.'),
(1008, '2', '429', 'BERTHA', 'Are you sure?'),
(1009, '2', '430', 'ROBERT', 'Who made us for one only? It is a crime against our own being if we are so. There is no law before impulse. Laws are for slaves. Bertha, say my name! Let me hear your voice say it. Softly!'),

(1016, '2', '438', 'ROBERT', 'Only the wind. We have light enough from the other room.'),
(1017, '2', '439', 'ROBERT', 'Are you happy? Tell me.'),

(1021, '2', '443', 'ROBERT', 'Do not go, Bertha! There is time still. Do you love me too? I have waited a long time. Do you love us both-- him and also me? Do you, Bertha? The truth! Tell me. Tell me with your eyes. Or speak!'),

(1062, '3', '65', 'BEATRICE', 'In the middle. It is headed:'),
(1063, '3', '66', 'BERTHA', 'Is it... for Dick or against him?'),
(1064, '3', '67', 'BEATRICE', 'O, for him! You can read what he says about Mr Rowan. And I know that Robert stayed in town very late last night to write it.'),
(1065, '3', '68', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. Are you sure?'),
(1066, '3', '69', 'BEATRICE', 'Yes. Very late. I heard him come home. It was long after two.'),
(1067, '3', '70', 'BERTHA', 'It alarmed you? I mean to be awakened at that hour of the morning.'),
(1068, '3', '71', 'BEATRICE', 'I am a light sleeper. But I knew he had come from the office and then... I suspected he had written an article about Mr Rowan and that was why he came so late.'),
(1069, '3', '72', 'BERTHA', 'How quick you were to think of that!'),
(1070, '3', '73', 'BEATRICE', 'Well, after what took place here yesterday afternoon-- I mean what Robert said, that Mr Rowan had accepted this position. It was only natural I should think...'),
(1071, '3', '74', 'BERTHA', 'Ah, yes. Naturally.'),
(1072, '3', '76', 'BERTHA', 'My God! What is it? Tell me.'),
(1073, '3', '77', 'BEATRICE', 'Why does that upset you so much?'),
(1074, '3', '78', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, of course, it is very foolish of me. My nerves are all upset. I slept very badly, too. That is why I got up so early. But tell me what was it then?'),
(1075, '3', '79', 'BEATRICE', 'Only the noise of his valise being pulled along the floor. Then I heard him walking about his room, whistling softly. And then locking it and strapping it.'),
(1076, '3', '80', 'BERTHA', 'He is going away!'),
(1077, '3', '81', 'BEATRICE', 'That was what alarmed me. I feared he had had a quarrel with Mr Rowan and that his article was an attack.'),
(1078, '3', '82', 'BERTHA', 'But why should they quarrel? Have you noticed anything between them?'),
(1079, '3', '83', 'BEATRICE', 'I thought I did. A coldness.'),

(1087, '3', '91', 'BEATRICE', 'I would be very sorry. You see, Mrs Rowan, Robert is my first cousin and it would grieve me very deeply if he were to treat Mr Rowan badly, now that he has come back, or if they had a serious quarrel especially because...'),
(1088, '3', '92', 'BERTHA', 'Because?'),
(1089, '3', '93', 'BEATRICE', 'Because it was my cousin who urged Mr Rowan always to come back. I have that on my conscience.'),
(1090, '3', '95', 'BEATRICE', 'On mine, too. Because-- I spoke to my cousin about Mr Rowan when he was away and, to a certain extent, it was I...'),

(1092, '3', '97', 'BEATRICE', 'I think so.'),

(1105, '3', '111', 'BEATRICE', 'I am not the only person who is intimate here.'),

In exile, we have said, but here we must distinguish. There is an economic and there is a spiritual exile. There are those who left her to seek the bread by which men live and there are others, nay, her most favoured children, who left her to seek in other lands that food of the spirit by which a nation of human beings is sustained in life. Those who recall the intellectual life of Dublin of a decade since will have many memories of Mr Rowan. Something of that fierce indignation which lacerated the heart...'),

(1174, '3', '188', 'BERTHA', 'To have it always to throw against me. To make me humble before you, as you always did. To be free yourself.  With her! And that is your love! Every word you say is false.'),
(1175, '3', '189', 'RICHARD', 'It is useless to ask you to listen to me.'),
(1176, '3', '190', 'BERTHA', 'Listen to you! She is the person for listening. Why would you waste your time with me? Talk to her.'),
(1177, '3', '191', 'RICHARD', 'I see. You have driven her away from me now, as you drove everyone else from my side-- every friend I ever had, every human being that ever tried to approach me. You hate her.'),
(1178, '3', '192', 'BERTHA', 'No such thing! I think you have made her unhappy as you have made me and as you made your dead mother unhappy and killed her. Woman-killer! That is your name.'),
(1179, '3', '193', 'RICHARD', ''),
(1180, '3', '194', 'BERTHA', 'She is a fine and high character. I like her. She is everything that I am not-- in birth and education. You tried to ruin her but you could not. Because she is well able for you-- what I am not. And you know it.'),
(1181, '3', '195', 'RICHARD', 'What the devil are you talking about her for?'),
(1182, '3', '196', 'BERTHA', 'O, how I wish I had never met you! How I curse that day!'),
(1183, '3', '197', 'RICHARD', 'I am in the way, is it? You would like to be free now. You have only to say the word.'),
(1184, '3', '198', 'BERTHA', 'Whenever you like I am ready.'),
(1185, '3', '199', 'RICHARD', 'So that you could meet your lover-- freely?'),
(1186, '3', '200', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(1187, '3', '201', 'RICHARD', 'Night after night?'),
(1188, '3', '202', 'BERTHA', 'My lover! Yes! My lover!'),
(1189, '3', '203', 'RICHARD', 'Bertha!  Bertha, you are free.'),
(1190, '3', '205', 'ROBERT', 'You sent for me.'),
(1191, '3', '206', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. Are you mad to think of going away like that-- without even coming here-- without saying anything?'),
(1192, '3', '207', 'ROBERT', 'What I have to say I said here.'),
(1193, '3', '208', 'BERTHA', 'When did you write it? Last night-- after I went away?'),
(1194, '3', '209', 'ROBERT', 'To be quite accurate, I wrote part of it-- in my mind-- before you went away. The rest-- the worst part-- I wrote after. Much later.'),
(1195, '3', '210', 'BERTHA', 'And you could write last night!'),
(1196, '3', '211', 'ROBERT', 'Why do you not look at me? May I not touch you?'),
(1197, '3', '212', 'BERTHA', 'Dick is in there.'),
(1198, '3', '213', 'ROBERT', 'In that case children be good.'),
(1199, '3', '214', 'BERTHA', 'Where are you going?'),
(1200, '3', '215', 'ROBERT', 'To foreign parts. That is, to my cousin Jack Justice,  Doggy Justice, in Surrey. He has a nice country place there and the air is mild.'),
(1201, '3', '216', 'BERTHA', 'Why are you going?'),
(1202, '3', '217', 'ROBERT', 'Can you not guess one reason?'),
(1203, '3', '218', 'BERTHA', 'On account of me?'),
(1204, '3', '219', 'ROBERT', 'Yes. It is not pleasant for me to remain here just now.'),
(1205, '3', '220', 'BERTHA', 'But this is cruel of you, Robert. Cruel to me and to him also.'),
(1206, '3', '221', 'ROBERT', 'Has he asked... what happened?'),
(1207, '3', '222', 'BERTHA', 'No. He refuses to ask me anything. He says he will never know.'),
(1208, '3', '223', 'ROBERT', 'Richard is right there. He is always right.'),
(1209, '3', '224', 'BERTHA', 'But, Robert, you must speak to him.'),
(1210, '3', '225', 'ROBERT', 'What am I to say to him?'),
(1211, '3', '226', 'BERTHA', 'The truth! Everything!'),
(1212, '3', '227', 'ROBERT', 'No, Bertha. I am a man speaking to a man. I cannot tell him everything.'),
(1213, '3', '228', 'BERTHA', 'He will believe that you are going away because you are afraid to face him after last night.'),
(1214, '3', '229', 'ROBERT', 'Well, I am not a coward any more than he. I will see him.'),
(1215, '3', '230', 'BERTHA', 'I will call him.'),
(1216, '3', '231', 'ROBERT', 'Were you mine in that sacred night of love? Or have I dreamed it?'),
(1217, '3', '232', 'BERTHA', 'Remember your dream of me. You dreamed that I was yours last night.'),
(1218, '3', '233', 'ROBERT', 'And that is the truth-- a dream? That is what I am to tell?'),
(1219, '3', '234', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(1220, '3', '235', 'ROBERT', 'And now I can tell him the truth. Call him.'),
(1221, '3', '236', 'BERTHA', 'Dick!  Dick! Answer me!'),
(1222, '3', '237', 'RICHARD', 'I thank you for your kind article about me. Is it true that you have come to say goodbye?'),
(1223, '3', '238', 'ROBERT', 'There is nothing to thank me for, Richard. Now and always I am your friend. Now more than ever before. Do you believe me, Richard?'),
(1224, '3', '239', 'THE FISHWOMAN', 'Fresh Dublin bay herrings! Fresh Dublin bay herrings! Dublin bay herrings!'),
(1225, '3', '240', 'ROBERT', 'I will tell you the truth, Richard. Are you listening?'),
(1226, '3', '241', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1227, '3', '242', 'THE FISHWOMAN', 'Fresh herrings! Dublin bay herrings!'),
(1228, '3', '243', 'ROBERT', 'I failed, Richard. That is the truth. Do you believe me?'),
(1229, '3', '244', 'RICHARD', 'I am listening.'),
(1230, '3', '245', 'ROBERT', 'I failed. She is yours, as she was nine years ago, when you met her first.'),
(1231, '3', '246', 'RICHARD', 'When we met her first, you mean.'),
(1232, '3', '247', 'ROBERT', 'Yes.  Shall I go on?'),
(1233, '3', '248', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1234, '3', '250', 'RICHARD', 'Then?'),
(1235, '3', '251', 'ROBERT', 'Then I went to a certain nightclub. There were men there-- and also women. At least, they looked like women. I danced with one of them. She asked me to see her home. Shall I go on?'),
(1236, '3', '252', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1237, '3', '253', 'ROBERT', 'I saw her home in a cab. She lives near Donnybrook. In the cab took place what the subtle Duns Scotus calls a death of the spirit. Shall I go on?'),
(1238, '3', '254', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1239, '3', '255', 'ROBERT', 'She wept. She told me she was the divorced wife of a barrister. I offered her a sovereign as she told me she was short of money. She would not take it and wept very much. Then she drank some melissa water from a little bottle which she had in her satchel. I saw her enter her house. Then I walked home. In my room I found that my coat was all stained with the melissa water. I had no luck even with my coats yesterday: that was the second one. The idea came to me then to change my suit and go away by the morning boat. I packed my valise and went to bed. I am going away by the next train to my cousin, Jack Justice, in Surrey. Perhaps for a fortnight. Perhaps longer. Are you disgusted?'),
(1240, '3', '256', 'RICHARD', 'Why did you not go by the boat?'),
(1241, '3', '257', 'ROBERT', 'I slept it out.'),
(1242, '3', '258', 'RICHARD', 'You intended to go without saying goodbye-- without coming here?'),
(1243, '3', '259', 'ROBERT', 'Yes.'),
(1244, '3', '260', 'RICHARD', 'Why?'),
(1245, '3', '261', 'ROBERT', 'My story is not very nice, is it?'),
(1246, '3', '262', 'RICHARD', 'But you have come.'),
(1247, '3', '263', 'ROBERT', 'Bertha sent me a message to come.'),
(1248, '3', '264', 'RICHARD', 'But for that...?'),
(1249, '3', '265', 'ROBERT', 'But for that I should not have come.'),
(1250, '3', '266', 'RICHARD', 'Did it strike you that if you had gone without coming here I should have understood it-- in my own way?'),
(1251, '3', '267', 'ROBERT', 'Yes, it did.'),
(1252, '3', '268', 'RICHARD', 'What, then, do you wish me to believe?'),
(1253, '3', '269', 'ROBERT', 'I wish you to believe that I failed. That Bertha is yours now as she was nine years ago, when you-- when we-- met her first.'),
(1254, '3', '270', 'RICHARD', 'Do you want to know what I did?'),
(1255, '3', '271', 'ROBERT', 'No.'),
(1256, '3', '272', 'RICHARD', 'I came home at once.'),
(1257, '3', '273', 'ROBERT', 'Did you hear Bertha return?'),
(1258, '3', '274', 'RICHARD', 'No. I wrote all the night. And thought.  In there. Before dawn I went out and walked the strand from end to end.'),
(1259, '3', '275', 'ROBERT', 'Suffering. Torturing yourself.'),
(1260, '3', '276', 'RICHARD', 'Hearing voices about me. The voices of those who say they love me.'),
(1261, '3', '277', 'ROBERT', 'One. And mine?'),
(1262, '3', '278', 'RICHARD', 'Another still.'),
(1263, '3', '279', 'ROBERT', 'True. My interesting but somewhat melancholy cousin. And what did they tell you?'),
(1264, '3', '280', 'RICHARD', 'They told me to despair.'),
(1265, '3', '281', 'ROBERT', 'A queer way of showing their love, I must say! And will you despair?'),
(1266, '3', '282', 'RICHARD', 'No.'),
(1267, '3', '283', 'ARCHIE', 'Open the window! Open the window!'),
(1268, '3', '284', 'ROBERT', 'Listen! How full it is of despair!'),
(1269, '3', '285', 'ARCHIE', 'Open the window, please, will you?'),
(1270, '3', '286', 'ROBERT', 'Perhaps, there, Richard, is the freedom we seek-- you in one way, I in another. In him and not in us. Perhaps...'),
(1271, '3', '287', 'RICHARD', 'Perhaps...?'),
(1272, '3', '288', 'ROBERT', 'I said  I would say almost surely if...'),
(1273, '3', '289', 'RICHARD', 'If what?'),
(1274, '3', '290', 'ROBERT', 'If he were mine.'),
(1275, '3', '291', 'ROBERT', 'Like yesterday-- eh?'),
(1276, '3', '292', 'ARCHIE', 'Good morning, Mr Hand.'),
(1277, '3', '293', 'RICHARD', 'Archie.'),
(1278, '3', '294', 'ROBERT', 'And where were you, my young gentleman?'),
(1279, '3', '295', 'ARCHIE', 'Out with the milkman. I drove the horse. We went to Booterstown.  I am very hungry.'),
(1280, '3', '296', 'ROBERT', 'To our next meeting!'),
(1281, '3', '297', 'RICHARD', 'Goodbye.'),
(1282, '3', '299', 'ARCHIE', 'May I, mamma?'),
(1283, '3', '300', 'BERTHA', 'Yes.'),
(1284, '3', '301', 'ARCHIE', 'I am ready.'),
(1285, '3', '302', 'ROBERT', 'Goodbye to pappa and mamma. But not a big goodbye.'),
(1286, '3', '303', 'ARCHIE', 'Will you tell me a fairy story, Mr Hand?'),
(1287, '3', '304', 'ROBERT', 'A fairy story? Why not? I am your fairy godfather.'),
(1288, '3', '305', 'BERTHA', 'Dick, dear, do you believe now that I have been true to you? Last night and always?'),
(1289, '3', '306', 'RICHARD', 'Do not ask me, Bertha.'),
(1290, '3', '307', 'BERTHA', 'I have been, dear. Surely you believe me. I gave you myself-- all. I gave up all for you. You took me-- and you left me.'),
(1291, '3', '308', 'RICHARD', 'When did I leave you?'),
(1292, '3', '309', 'BERTHA', 'You left me: and I waited for you to come back to me. Dick, dear, come here to me. Sit down. How tired you must be!'),
(1293, '3', '310', 'BERTHA', 'Yes, dear. I waited for you. Heavens, what I suffered then-- when we lived in Rome! Do you remember the terrace of our house?'),
(1294, '3', '311', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1295, '3', '312', 'BERTHA', 'I used to sit there, waiting, with the poor child with his toys, waiting till he got sleepy. I could see all the roofs of the city and the river, the  What is its name?'),
(1296, '3', '313', 'RICHARD', 'The Tiber.'),
(1297, '3', '314', 'BERTHA', 'It was lovely, Dick, only I was so sad. I was alone, Dick, forgotten by you and by all. I felt my life was ended.'),
(1298, '3', '315', 'RICHARD', 'It had not begun.'),
(1299, '3', '316', 'BERTHA', 'And I used to look at the sky, so beautiful, without a cloud and the city you said was so old: and then I used to think of Ireland and about ourselves.'),
(1300, '3', '317', 'RICHARD', 'Ourselves?'),
(1301, '3', '318', 'BERTHA', 'Yes. Ourselves. Not a day passes that I do not see ourselves, you and me, as we were when we met first. Every day of my life I see that. Was I not true to you all that time?'),
(1302, '3', '319', 'RICHARD', 'Yes, Bertha. You were my bride in exile.'),
(1303, '3', '320', 'BERTHA', 'Wherever you go, I will follow you. If you wish to go away now I will go with you.'),
(1304, '3', '321', 'RICHARD', 'I will remain. It is too soon yet to despair.'),
(1305, '3', '322', 'BERTHA', 'It is not true that I want to drive everyone from you. I wanted to bring you close together-- you and him. Speak to me. Speak out all your heart to me. What you feel and what you suffer.'),
(1306, '3', '323', 'RICHARD', 'I am wounded, Bertha.'),
(1307, '3', '324', 'BERTHA', 'How wounded, dear? Explain to me what you mean. I will try to understand everything you say. In what way are you wounded?'),
(1308, '3', '325', 'RICHARD', 'I have a deep, deep wound of doubt in my soul.'),
(1309, '3', '326', 'BERTHA', 'Doubt of me?'),
(1310, '3', '327', 'RICHARD', 'Yes.'),
(1311, '3', '328', 'BERTHA', 'I am yours.  If I died this moment, I am yours.'),
(1312, '3', '329', 'RICHARD', 'I have wounded my soul for you-- a deep wound of doubt which can never be healed. I can never know, never in this world. I do not wish to know or to believe. I do not care. It is not in the darkness of belief that I desire you. But in restless living wounding doubt. To hold you by no bonds, even of love, to be united with you in body and soul in utter nakedness-- for this I longed. And now I am tired for a while, Bertha. My wound tires me.'),
(1313, '3', '330', 'BERTHA', 'Forget me, Dick. Forget me and love me again as you did the first time. I want my lover. To meet him, to go to him, to give myself to him. You, Dick. O, my strange wild lover, come back to me again!');
